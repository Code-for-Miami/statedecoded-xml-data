District 7: 1 member
District 11: 6 members
If a Study Area is contracted as required by Section 20-29 of the Code because a Commissioner does not consent to the inclusion of any portion of his or her district in the Study area, the number of members any Commissioner is entitled to appoint will be modified proportionately. Upon such occurrence, the Mayor or the Mayor's designee shall then determine the percentage of population in the Study Area in each Commission district as compared to the population of the total Study Area, as revised, compute the number of appointments per Commissioner, and shall notify each affected Commissioner of how many appointments are to be made based on the revised Study Area. Alternatively, should the Study Area be expanded as authorized by this article, the number of appointments to be made by any Commissioner shall be determined utilizing the procedure set forth above for contraction of the Study Area.
