The City of North Miami Community Redevelopment and Revitalization Trust Fund (the "Fund") is hereby established. Each taxing authority (as defined in the Act) shall annually pay into the Fund, an amount not less than that increment in the income, proceeds, revenues and funds of each taxing authority derived from or held in connection with the undertaking and carrying out of community redevelopment in accordance with the Act. The increment shall be determined annually and shall be that amount equal to 95 percent of the difference between: (1) the amount of ad valorem taxes levied each year by each taxing authority; exclusive of any amount from any debt service millage, on taxable real property contained within the geographic boundaries of the Redevelopment Area; and (b) the amount of ad valorem taxes which would have been produced by the rate upon which the tax is levied each year by or for each taxing authority, exclusive of any debt service millage, upon the total of the assessed value of the taxable real property in the Redevelopment Area as shown upon the most recent assessment roll used in connection with the taxation of such property by each taxing authority prior to the effective date of this article.

Except for the purpose of funding the Fund pursuant to Section 2-1843 herein, upon the enactment of this article, each taxing authority shall, by January 1st of each year, appropriate to the Fund for so long as any indebtedness pledging increment revenues to the payment thereof is outstanding, but not to exceed thirty (30) years, a sum that is no less than the increment as defined and determined by Section 2-1841 of this article accruing to such taxing authority. In no year shall the County's obligation to the Fund exceed the amount of that year's tax increment as determined pursuant to Section 2-1841 of this article. Beginning with the twentieth year after the date of sale of the initial bonding or indebtedness pledging tax increment funds, no new sale of bonds or indebtedness supported by the County's tax increment may occur nor may existing indebtedness so supported be refunded without amending this article. The County's increment contribution is to be accounted for as separate revenue within the Fund but may be combined within other revenues for the purpose of paying debt service. The County must approve the amount, duration of the obligation and the purpose of any bond, note or other form of indebtedness, including advances, pledging or otherwise obligating tax increment funds.
