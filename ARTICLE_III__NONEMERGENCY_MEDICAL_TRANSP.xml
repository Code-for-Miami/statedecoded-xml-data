This article shall be known as the "Nonemergency Medical Transportation Ordinance."
</text>
<catch_line>Sec. 4-42. Legislative findings and intent</catch_line>
<text>
<section prefix = "a">
During the 1979 State legislative session, authority for regulation of nonemergency medical transportation was transferred from the Public Service Commission to the Department of Health and Rehabilitative Services (Chapter 401, Florida Statutes). It mandated the elimination of economic regulations at the State level and required each County to establish local control of the industry. A prior condition for obtaining a State license and permit is a County certificate of public convenience and necessity.
</section>
<section prefix = "b">
The purpose of this article is to ensure the health and safety of those citizens who must use nonemergency transportation. Regulation of the nonemergency medical transportation industry is susceptible to and can most effectively be carried out under a uniform plan of regulation to [of] the County as a whole.
</section>
<section prefix = "c">
Artificial restrictions upon the nonemergency medical transportation industry based solely upon economic regulations, that limit competition and impose unreasonable standards on the industry, are not in the best interest of the health, welfare, safety and convenience of the handicapped and disabled residents of the County who rely on this form of transportation. The riding public should not be required to bear the effects of governmentally imposed restrictions upon the industry which are artificial or unnecessary.

Said notice shall specify the Director's proposed action and the grounds upon which the action is predicated. The operator or chauffeur may be represented by legal counsel and shall be entitled to present a defense to the proposed action. Failure to appear at a duly noticed hearing shall be deemed a waiver of the right to hearing and an admission of the acts specified in the notice.
