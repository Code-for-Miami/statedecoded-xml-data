Shoreline setbacks.
<section prefix = "a">
The minimum shoreline setback shall be twenty-five (25) feet for building elevations not exceeding thirty-five (35) feet in height measured vertically from the mean high water line to top of the building parapet. The shoreline setback shall be measured from the water side of the cap of the bulkhead, seawall or the top of the riprap (where said riprap has been placed in accordance with the provisions of Chapter 24 of the Miami-Dade County Code) or from the mean high water line as defined in Chapter 177, Part 2, Florida Statutes, where no bulkhead, seawall or riprap exists.
</section>
<section prefix = "b">
For building elevations exceeding thirty-five (35) feet in height measured vertically from the mean high water line to the top of the building parapet, the minimum shoreline setback shall be increased by fifty (50) percent of the additional height of the building to a maximum setback of seventy-five (75) feet.

The Shoreline Development Review Committee shall review the status of all setback areas every two (2) years and shall petition the appropriate local government(s) to acquire, develop, maintain and assume liability for portions of the public shoreline walkway as it becomes feasible. Design of the shoreline walkway shall be in conformance with the guidelines in the shoreline development review manual in the implementing resolution adopted pursuant to this article.
</section>
</section>
<section prefix = "2">
Visual corridors.
<section prefix = "a">
Where a lot or parcel is located between the shoreline and a public roadway, an unimpeded visual corridor to the Biscayne Bay of twenty (20) percent of the width of the lot (up to one hundred (100) feet maximum) shall be provided on one (1) side of the parcel. The minimum width of said visual corridor shall be twenty (20) feet. Parking, accessory or ancillary structures shall not be permitted in said viewing corridor.

<section prefix = "a">
That a waiver or variance of municipal or County code(s) be sought to provide the required shoreline and side setback and visual corridor except where it would be impossible or highly impractical to provide the required shoreline or side setback or visual corridor as a result of the size or configuration of the subject site.
</section>
<section prefix = "b">
That additional public amenities such as a shoreline walkway, parks, docks, fishing piers, boardwalks, or viewing platforms be provided on site or at an adjacent public right-of-way and that appropriate provisions for maintenance of said facilities in perpetuity be made.
</section>
<section prefix = "c">
That a connection be provided and maintained between existing public shoreline access facilities across or around the proposed development or along an existing right-of-way.
If none of the above actions is deemed appropriate by the Shoreline Review Committee, then the Committee shall recommend that improvement of shoreline access for the general public be provided at a specified nearby public site or right-of-way either through contributions of land and/or material or through contribution to the Biscayne Bay environmental enhancement trust fund for the purpose of providing public access to the shoreline within the shoreline development review boundary. Said access site(s) should preferentially be within one-half mile of the proposed development site and within the same shoreline basin area.

<catch_line>Sec. 33D-39. Judicial review</catch_line>
<text>
Whenever any municipal or County authority renders or issues any ordinance, resolution, permit or order in regard to any development action which meets the thresholds set forth in Section 33D-34 hereinabove or plan within the shoreline development review boundary, a copy of such ordinance, resolution, permit or order shall be submitted forthwith to the County staff coordinator of the Shoreline Development Review Committee. It shall be the duty of the County staff coordinator to place the matter before the Committee as soon as is reasonably practical, and in any event not less than twenty (20) days from the rendition of the ordinance, resolution, permit or order. At its meeting, the Committee shall consider whether, and the extent to which, the municipal or County authority has departed from the requirements of this article. Where it appears that the action of the municipal or County authority is substantially contrary to the Committee's recommendations and report, the Committee may authorize the filing or appropriate judicial proceedings in the Circuit Court for the Eleventh Judicial Circuit in and for Miami-Dade County, Florida, to contest the action of the County or municipal authority.

<text>
<section prefix = "a">
Exemptions.
<section prefix = "1">
The provisions of this article shall not apply to an application for development action to the extent that the land affected by said application is subject to a County and locally approved redevelopment plan adopted in accordance with Florida Statutes, Section 163.330 et seq., a site plan, declaration of restrictions or similar agreement, covenant or other criteria or parameters governing land development which has been lawfully issued, adopted or approved prior to the effective date of this article by the Board of County Commissioners, the Zoning Appeals Board, the applicable board of a municipal governing body, an administrative official having authority under applicable ordinance or regulation, or a court of competent jurisdiction. The exemption provided in this subsection shall have continuing effect where the development proceeds in substantial compliance with the subject approval and said approval has not lapsed, expired, been revoked or otherwise rendered invalid.
</section>
<section prefix = "2">
The provisions of this article shall not apply to an application to modify or amend an approval granted prior to the effective date of this article pursuant to subsection (a)(1) herein, where the Executive Council of the Miami-Dade County Developmental Impact Committee finds and determines in accordance with Section 33D-35 herein that the requested modification or amendment will not alter the immediate bay shoreline, will not alter the physical or visual character of the shoreline setback area or the potential of that area to accommodate a shoreline walkway at some future time, and will not alter the character of the side setback in such a way as to diminish the use of that area as an existing or future visual or physical access corridor to the bay shoreline.
</section>
</section>
<section prefix = "b">
Vested rights.
<section prefix = "1">
Nothing contained herein shall be construed as depriving an applicant of lawfully vested rights. It shall be the duty and responsibility of the applicant alleging vested rights to affirmatively demonstrate the legal requisites of vested rights. Any person who claims a vested right to develop property contrary to this article may submit an application for a determination of vested rights to the Executive Council of the Miami-Dade County Developmental Impact Committee (DIC) together with a sworn affidavit setting forth the facts upon which the applicant bases his claim for vested rights. In addition to any other submission required by the DIC, the applicant shall include copies of any contracts, letters and other documents upon which a claim of vested rights is based. The mere existence of zoning prior to the effective date of this article shall not vest rights.
</section>
<section prefix = "2">
The Executive Council of the DIC shall review the application as provided in Section 33D-35 and implementing resolutions adopted pursuant to this article and determine whether the applicant has demonstrated:
<section prefix = "a">
An act of development approval by an agency of Miami-Dade County or an applicable municipal governing body,
</section>
<section prefix = "b">
Upon which the developer has in good faith relied to his detriment,
</section>
<section prefix = "c">
Such that it would be highly inequitable to deny the landowner the right to complete the previously approved development.
