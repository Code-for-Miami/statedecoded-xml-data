<catch_line>Sec. 23-23. Credits to individual accounts</catch_line>
<text>
<section prefix = "a">
An individual account shall be established for each Police Officer of permanent status on the effective date of this ordinance [article], and for each Police Officer who attains permanent status subsequent to the passage of this ordinance [article].
</section>
<section prefix = "b">
After payment of all costs, expenses and fees as monies are received from the State, the expenses of administering the fund for the preceding year shall be prorated by the Board and charged against monies received for Police Officer participants during said year; and the balance of such monies shall be credited to the several individual participants in amount directly proportionate to the total number of months of duty performed by the several Police Officers in the calendar year preceding the date the monies were received from the State. The length of time of service during the calendar year preceding the date upon which payment is received from the State is the only criterion upon which the amount due each participant out of the State monies received annually is to be calculated. No credit is to be given on account of seniority, rank or amount of compensation which the participants receive. Twenty (20) or more days' work in a calendar month shall be counted as a full month. Twenty (20) work days shall be considered a full month. If a participant works less than twenty (20) days in any calendar month, he shall be credited with a fractional month, the fraction to be the number of days worked over twenty (20). Example: Twelve (12) days worked would create a fraction of twelve-twentieths of a month.
</section>
<section prefix = "c">
The amount of earnings from investments credited to the account of the participant shall bear the same ratio to the total amount of annual earnings as the invested funds belonging to the participant in the fund bear to the total monies invested on behalf of the fund.
</section>
<section prefix = "d">
In addition to the monies received from the State and as earnings on investments, there shall be prorated and credited to the accounts of the individual participants, all forfeitures from Police Officers as provided for in Section 23-24 hereof. Such sums shall be prorated to their individual accounts in the same manner as monies received from the State.
</section>
<section prefix = "e">
After a Police Officer has retired and ceased to be a member on active duty, as defined in Section 23-2(a) hereof, no credits shall be made to his account. Monies credited to a participant's account shall be payable only upon the filing of an application with the Board. The application shall be on a form prescribed by the Board and shall be sworn to by the applicant or his surviving wife or child, or if the child is a minor, by the guardian of the child, or by any other person legally qualified to apply for such monies under the laws of the State of Florida.

All monies remaining in a participant's account after separation as above shall be forfeited to the fund.

</section>
<section prefix = "b">
If a participant shall die while a member of the Metro-Dade Police Department, the entire amount of his credit, as of the date of his death, shall be paid to his surviving wife, primarily for the purpose of defraying final illness and burial expenses. If there be no surviving wife and there is a child or children, the entire amount of participant's credit, as of the date of his death, shall be paid to a person designated in writing by the participant, to be used for payment of final illness and burial expenses, with any excess to be paid to the legal guardian of the child or children for their benefit. If there be no surviving wife or children, there shall be paid to the person designated in writing by the participant, to be used for payment of final illness and burial expenses, an amount not to exceed the entire amount of his credit and any excess after payment of final illness and burial expenses shall be paid as designated by the deceased.

In carrying out the purpose of this subsection, the Board shall endeavor to distribute any excess monies after payment of last illness and burial expenses in the same manner in which they would have been distributed in an intestate administration proceeding.

A participant who shall hereafter be retired by reason of length of service or disability under any other pension plan of the County and/or State, or who shall retire after completing nine (9) years of service with the Metro-Dade Police Department, shall be paid the entire amount standing to his credit as of the date of such retirement or separation. He shall elect to take such amount in a lump sum, or to take it in annual payments over a period not to exceed five (5) years. A written notice of election to receive payments other than in a lump sum must be filed with the Board upon a form prescribed by the Board therefor, and must be sworn to by the person entitled to receive such monies.
A retired participant or a participant who has separated from the Department after nine (9) years active service who has elected to receive the monies due him in annual payments, rather than a lump sum as above, shall not be an active participant under Section 23-2(g).
</section>
<section prefix = "d">
Settlement as provided in subsection (a), (b) and (c) of this section shall be in full settlement of all claims of a participant against the fund, and he shall thereupon cease to be a participant, and he shall have no further interest in said fund, and shall receive no further benefits.
</section>
<section prefix = "e">
As an alternative to the above benefits, in event that a court of competent jurisdiction should find and order that a participant is entitled to benefits under Chapter 28230 different from the benefits which that participant is entitled to receive under the terms of this ordinance [article], and such participant does not waive the benefits decreed by the court and accept benefits as provided by this ordinance [article], the Trustees shall pay to such participants benefits as required by the decree or order of the court. Such benefits shall be paid from the fund, and in the event that it is necessary to pay such participant a greater amount than he would have received had he accepted benefits under this ordinance [article], such additional amount shall be deducted from the accounts of the other participants on a pro rata basis as determined by the Board of Trustees. The fund shall indemnify the County against all claims of participants as aforesaid and shall pay all expenses including court costs and attorneys' fees incurred in defending law suits brought by participants in asserting such claims.
