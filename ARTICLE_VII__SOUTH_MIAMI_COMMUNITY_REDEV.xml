The South Miami Community Redevelopment and Revitalization Trust Fund (the "Fund") is hereby established. Each taxing authority (as defined in the Act) shall annually pay into the Fund, a sum not less than that increment in the income, proceeds, revenues and funds of each taxing authority derived from or held in connection with the undertaking and carrying out of community redevelopment in accordance with the Plan. The increment shall be determined annually and shall be that amount equal to fifty (50) percent of the difference between:
<section prefix = "a">
The amount of ad valorem taxes levied each year by each taxing authority, exclusive of any amount from any debt service millage, on taxable real property contained within the geographic boundaries of the Redevelopment Area; and
</section>
<section prefix = "b">
The amount of ad valorem taxes which would have been produced by the rate upon which the tax is levied each year by or for each taxing authority, exclusive of any debt service millage, upon the total of the assessed value of the taxable real property in the Redevelopment Area as shown upon the most recent assessment roll used in connection with the taxation of such property by each taxing authority prior to the effective date of this ordinance.

<catch_line>Sec. 30A-153. County appropriations to Fund</catch_line>
<text>
Each taxing authority shall, by January 1st of each year, appropriate to the Fund for so long as any indebtedness pledging increment revenues to the payment thereof is outstanding (but not to exceed thirty (30) years) a sum that is no less than the increment as defined and determined by Section 2 of this ordinance accruing to such taxing authority. In no year shall the County's obligation to the Fund exceed the amount of that year's tax increment as determined pursuant to Section 2 of this ordinance. Beginning with the twentieth year after the date of sale of the initial bonding or indebtedness pledging tax increment funds, no new sale of bonds or indebtedness supported by the County's tax increment may occur nor may existing indebtedness so supported be refunded without amending this Ordinance. The County's obligation to fund the Fund annually shall continue until all loans, advances and indebtedness, if any, and interest thereon, of the Agency incurred as a result of redevelopment in the Redevelopment Area have been paid. The County's increment contribution is to be accounted for as a separate revenue within the Fund but may be combined within other revenues for the purpose of paying debt service. The County must approve the amount, duration of the obligation and the purpose of any bond, note or other form of indebtedness, including advances, pledging or otherwise obligating tax increment funds.
