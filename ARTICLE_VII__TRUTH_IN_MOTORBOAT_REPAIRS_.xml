<catch_line>Sec. 8A-155. False charges for motorboat repairs and parts</catch_line>
<text>
It is unlawful for a person to knowingly charge for any services which are not actually performed in repairing a motorboat, or to knowingly charge for any parts which are not actually furnished, or to knowingly misinform a customer concerning what is wrong with his motorboat, or to fraudulently substitute parts when such substitution has no relation to the repairing or servicing of the motorboat.
</text>
<catch_line>Sec. 8A-156. Estimate of repairs required</catch_line>
<text>
A person engaged in the business of motorboat repairs shall furnish to the customer a written estimate of repairs which shall state the total estimate cost of (1) parts: parts shall be listed with reasonable particularity and identified by brand name and designation as to whether new or used parts are to be installed; (2) labor; (3) incidental services; (4) the charges, if any, for the release of the motorboat in the event that the motorboat is not repaired; and (5) the charges, if any, for making the estimate. The customer may, in writing, waive this requirement. If no charge is recorded for the making of an estimate, it shall be unlawful to so charge for an estimate. No person shall be required to prepare a written estimate of repairs for jobs under fifty dollars ($50.00) nor until such person has made a visual inspection of the motorboat to be repaired; provided, however, that if inspection indicates an estimated repair cost in excess of fifty dollars ($50.00), an estimate in accordance with the terms and provisions of this article shall be required prior to the commencement of repair work. The customer shall be given a signed copy of the written estimate of repairs. No person engaged in the business of motorboat repairs shall solicit or demand a waiver of any customer's rights herein enumerated as a pre-condition to acceptance of repair work.

<catch_line>Sec. 8A-157. Notification of customer</catch_line>
<text>
In the event that a determination is made that the actual charges for the repairs to be made will exceed the total written estimate for repairs given under Section 8A-156 by the sum of ten dollars ($10.00) or ten (10) percent of the total written estimate, whichever is less, the customer shall be immediately notified by fax, telephone, telegram, mail or written notice of the new estimate charges. Such notification shall be at the expense of the person engaged in the business of motorboat repairs. A customer so notified may authorize the repairs based upon the new estimate charges or may cancel the order for repairs. (If the customer authorizes or cancels by telephone, it must be confirmed in writing.) If the order for repair is cancelled by the customer, the unrepaired or partially repaired motorboat shall be released immediately, in reasonable like condition as and where received for repair and upon payment of whatever charge is imposed for the release of the unrepaired motorboat in an amount not to exceed the estimate therefor as provided in Section 8A-156(4) hereof, if such estimate was included in the written estimate of repairs.
