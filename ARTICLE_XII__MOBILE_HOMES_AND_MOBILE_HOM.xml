<catch_line>Sec. 33-166. Purpose and intent</catch_line>
<text>
It is the purpose and intent of this article to provide regulations to control the use of mobile homes and to establish standards for mobile home parks which will promote the placement of parks in appropriate locations where there exist or would be provided the basic amenities and services akin to those in low- and medium-density areas, and to provide for the grouping of these mobile home units to make an efficient aesthetically pleasing use of land within the mobile home community so that a high-quality residential area will be created and maintained for the benefit of the mobile home community and adjacent properties and the public as a whole.
Mobile home parks provide alternative forms of housing and add to the diversity of affordable housing opportunities for the residents of unincorporated Miami-Dade County. It is the goal of the Board of County Commissioners of Miami-Dade County to preserve the diversity and stock of low cost housing alternatives. The Board of County Commissioners and the Community Zoning Advisory Boards will evaluate the impacts to the available supply of this form of low cost housing when hearing zoning applications to change the use of land which is an existing mobile home park.
