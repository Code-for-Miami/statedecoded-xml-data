Editor's note— Section 12 of Ord. No. 75-50, enacted July 2, 1975, provided that said ordinance be included in this Code, but did not specify the manner of inclusion, hence codification of §§ 1—9, as Art. XI, §§ 21-131—21-139, was at the discretion of the editors. Sections 10 and 11 of said ordinance, applicability and severability provisions, have been omitted; § 13, effective date, provided that the provisions of said ordinance shall become effective ten (10) days after the date of enactment thereof, except that anyone required to obtain said permit and any permits issued prior to Oct. 1, 1975, shall expire on Sept. 30, 1976. For the information of the user of this Code, the "whereas" clauses of Ord. No. 75-50 read as follows: (Back)
WHEREAS, Section 849.093(1), Florida Statutes, recites: (Back)
"(1) None of the provisions of this chapter shall be construed to prohibit or prevent nonprofit or veterans' organizations engaged in charitable, civic, community, benevolent, religious or scholastic works and/or other similar activities, which organizations have been in existence for a period of three (3) years or more from conducting bingo games or guest games, provided that the entire proceeds derived from the conduct of such games shall be donated by such organizations to the endeavors mentioned above. In no case shall the proceeds from the conduct of such games be used for any other purpose whatsoever"; and (Back)
"WHEREAS, Section 849.093(2), Florida Statutes, recites in part: (Back)
"(2) If an organization is not engaged in efforts of the type set out above, its right to conduct bingo or guest games hereunder shall be conditioned upon the return of all the proceeds from such games to the players in the form of prizes…"; and (Back)
WHEREAS, Section 849.093(6), Florida Statutes, recites: (Back)
"(6) All persons involved in the conduct of any bingo or guest game must be a resident of the community where the organization is located and a bona fide member of the organization sponsoring such games and shall not be compensated in any way for operation of said bingo or guest game."; and (Back)
WHEREAS, Section 849.093(2), Florida Statutes, recites: (Back)
"(8) Bingo or guest games shall be held only on property owned by the nonprofit organization or by the charity or organization that will benefit by the proceeds, on property leased full time by such organization for a period of not less than one (1) year, or on property owned by and leased from another nonprofit organization qualified under this section."; and (Back)
WHEREAS, present laws governing the operation of bingo games as provided for in Section 849.093, Florida Statutes, are inadequate to ensure that the various charitable, civic, community, benevolent, religious and scholastic organizations receive all the proceeds to which they are entitled under State law; and (Back)
WHEREAS, since monies from bingo games are frequently retained illegally or taken out for noncharitable purposes through such ruses as abnormally high rentals and salaries; and (Back)
WHEREAS, the Board of County Commissioners wishes to ensure effective enforcement of the above-quoted State laws regarding "bingo games" and to see that the proceeds from such games pass into the hands of legitimate charitable organizations to be used for legitimate charitable purposes. (Back)
