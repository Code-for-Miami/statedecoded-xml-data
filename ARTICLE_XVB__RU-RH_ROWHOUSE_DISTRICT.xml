<catch_line>Sec. 33-202.4. Purpose and intent</catch_line>
<text>
It is the intent of these regulations to create a Rowhouse District to be applied in unincorporated Miami-Dade County. Further, it is the purpose and intent of these regulations to create developments at a pedestrian scale; to create a streetscape which is convenient and comfortable for walking; to form a clear edge of public and private buildings, spatially delineating the public street space from private block interiors; to encourage pedestrian interaction between the development site and public areas; to provide a range of building elevations; to provide an identity, visual interest and diversity, and to provide opportunities for citizens to know their neighbors and watch over their collective security.
</text>
<catch_line>Sec. 33-202.5. Definitions</catch_line>
<text>
As used herein, a "rowhouse" is a one-family dwelling unit of a group of three (3) or more such units, each separated from the next by a common party fire wall; provided, however, that up to ten (10) percent of the total number of units on any individual site plan may be developed in two-unit groupings. Each common party fire wall shall extend to the roof line or above the roof of the units it serves and shall have no openings therein. Where units are offset from one another and a common party wall is used, the wall may be placed equidistant on each side of the lot line not exceeding the length of the offset. Each rowhouse unit shall be constructed upon a separate platted lot; provided, however, that the roof eaves may overhang onto adjacent lots or common areas a maximum of twenty-four (24) inches, subject to the approval of and determination by the Director that the roof or drainage system is designed so that runoff of water from the roof does not adversely affect adjacent units or lots. Each rowhouse unit shall be serviced with separate utilities and other facilities and shall otherwise be independent of one another.

<section prefix = "1">
Written approval is obtained from the official, authorized body designated in the rowhouse development to approve architectural changes in the rowhouse community; and
</section>
<section prefix = "2">
Written approval of the immediate adjacent rowhouse owner(s) is obtained. If the applicant is unable to contact an adjacent property owner for such approval, the applicant may present proof that he or she has mailed the request for approval to each adjacent unit owner, by certified mail, return receipt requested, at each adjacent property owner's mailing address as listed in the most current Miami-Dade County tax roll, and that the notice has been returned undeliverable; and

For the purposes of this subsection, temporary storm panels shall be defined as detachable protection devices that are installed temporarily over building openings in the event of an approaching hurricane or tropical storm.

The Director shall approve the change if it is determined that the change will be in harmony with and compatible with existing development in the area, and will not destroy the theme or character of the development in the area.
All adverse decisions of the official, authorized body designated in the rowhouse development to approve architectural changes in the rowhouse community shall be appealed solely pursuant to the provisions of the official documents of the rowhouse community. The official authorized body is required to afford the applicant, within sixty (60) days of receipt of the request, (1) written notice of the time and place of the hearing, (2) a full hearing, and (3) a decision in writing which is furnished to the applicant.
