<catch_line>Sec. 33-207.1. Repeal of RU-3B District</catch_line>
<text>
Article XVII of Chapter 33 of the Code of Miami-Dade County, Florida, entitled "RU-3B, Bungalow Court District" is hereby repealed, as it is the finding of County Commission that the use of property within the unincorporated area for bungalow court use, as provided in such article, provokes the overcrowding of property, an undue concentration of population, and is against the public health, morals, safety and welfare of the County; provided that any lots, parcels, tracts or areas heretofore zoned RU-3B shall retain such zoning classification and rights derived thereunder, until the same are rezoned in accordance with law.
</text>
<EditorsNote>
Section 33-207.1 was derived from Ord. No. 61-17, which was enacted as an addition to this Code and codified as § 33-207.1. Since the RU-3B classification is still effective for previously zoned areas, Article XVII has been retained.
