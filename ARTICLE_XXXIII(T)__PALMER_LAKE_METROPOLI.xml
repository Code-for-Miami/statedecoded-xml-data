<text>
This Article applies to the area bounded by the Miami River on the northeast, the Seaboard Air Line Railroad on the west, and the Tamiami Canal on the south, hereinafter referred to as the Palmer Lake Metropolitan Urban Center District (PLMUC). A more detailed legal description of this boundary is provided in Section 33-284.99.66 below. The intention of this Article is to permit the development of a Metropolitan Urban Center that fulfills the goals, objectives and policies of the Comprehensive Development Master Plan by:
<section prefix = "A">
Coordinating development intensity within the district by the proximity to mass transit.
</section>
<section prefix = "B">
Organizing an interconnected network of streets to improve pedestrian access to transit.
</section>
<section prefix = "C">
Creating attractive and usable public space by shaping the way buildings front onto streets and open spaces.
</section>
<section prefix = "D">
Maintaining and promoting marine activity on the Miami River by encouraging the retention of water dependent and/or water related uses consistent with the Port of Miami River Sub-element of the Comprehensive Development Master Plan.

The Illustrative Plan (Figure 1), illustrates the vision and may be used to better interpret this Article. Where there is conflict between the illustrative plan and the text of this Article, the text shall govern.
