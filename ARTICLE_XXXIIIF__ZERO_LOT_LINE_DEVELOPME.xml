<catch_line>Sec. 33-284.41. Legislative purposes</catch_line>
<text>
The principal purposes of the zero lot line concept are:
<section prefix = "1">
The more efficient use of land, as compared with the typical single-family development, making available needed housing at a more affordable cost.
</section>
<section prefix = "2">
The design of dwellings that integrate and relate internal-external living areas resulting in more pleasant and enjoyable living facilities.
</section>
<section prefix = "3">
By placing the dwelling against one (1) of the property lines, permitting the outdoor space to be grouped and utilized to its maximum benefit.

It is provided, however, that units are not required to be placed on the zero lot line property line when said units fall at the end of a sequential row of units and where said units cannot be placed on a separate zero lot line without attaching the unit to an adjacent unit. In that event a minimum spacing of ten (10) feet shall be provided from the residence on the adjacent zero lot line lot. Patios, pools, garden features and other similar elements shall be permitted within the ten-foot setback area; provided, however, no structure, with the exception of fences or walls shall be placed within easements required by Subsection (K).

The amount of penetrable opening for units between one thousand (1,000) square feet and fifteen hundred (1,500) square feet shall be calculated on a basis of 0.014 times the square feet of interior floor area on the ground floor. No additional penetrable opening shall be required when the ground floor square footage, excluding garage, exceeds fifteen hundred (1,500) square feet. In all cases, the final linear dimension of said openings shall be calculated to the nearest even foot.
