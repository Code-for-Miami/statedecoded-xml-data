<text>
The TND District is designed to ensure the development of land along the lines of traditional neighborhoods. Its provisions adapt the urban conventions which were normal in the United States from colonial times until the 1940's. The TND ordinance prescribes the following physical conventions:
<section prefix = "A">
The neighborhood is spatially understood and limited in size.
</section>
<section prefix = "B">
Residences, shops, workplaces, and civic buildings are interwoven within the neighborhood, all in close proximity.
</section>
<section prefix = "C">
A hierarchy of streets serves equitably the needs of the pedestrian, the bicycle and the automobile.
</section>
<section prefix = "D">
Carefully placed civic buildings, squares, and greens reinforce the identity of the neighborhood.
</section>
<section prefix = "E">
Spatially defined squares, parks, and greens provide places for social activity and recreation.
</section>
<section prefix = "F">
Civic buildings provide places of assembly for social, cultural and religious activities, becoming symbols of community identity through their architectural clarity.
</section>
<section prefix = "G">
Private buildings form a disciplined edge, spatially delineating the public street space and the private block interior.
</section>
<section prefix = "H">
Architecture and landscape respond to the unique character of the region.

Where the terms, design criteria, development parameters, and review procedure contained herein conflict with those provisions provided elsewhere in Chapter 33, the provisions of the TND shall apply.
