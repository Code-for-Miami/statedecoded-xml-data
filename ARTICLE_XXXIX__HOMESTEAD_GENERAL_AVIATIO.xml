All applications for permits made to appropriate municipal Building and Zoning Departments or agencies for all construction or for adding height to any existing structure, and for all alterations, repairs, or additions that will change the use of structure from the existing use to any commercial or industrial use in any airport zone classification district lying within a municipality for which airport zone classification district boundaries have been established herein, shall be approved by the Director and Building Official or by their duly authorized representatives prior to issuance of the permit by any municipal Building and Zoning Department or agency for the purpose of assuring compliance with the minimum standards governing zoning as set forth in this article; provided, however, no approval by the Director and Building Official will be required for building and use permits from municipalities which have adopted by ordinance effective airport zoning regulations, the minimum standards of which are at least as restrictive as the minimum standards prescribed herein as such apply to the areas covered by this article; no approval by the Director and Building Official will be required for building and use permits from municipalities which have adopted by ordinance effective general zoning regulations, the minimum standards of which are at least as restrictive as the minimum standards prescribed herein as such apply to the areas covered by this article; provided, however, that no municipality may grant any variance to said general zoning regulations which would make said minimum standards less restrictive than the minimum standards prescribed herein.
Permits will be approved by the Director and Building Official or their duly authorized representatives unless the proposal fails to meet the requirements of all applicable zoning regulations and building codes including the provisions of this article.
Permits when issued to applicants intending to use derricks, draglines, cranes and other boom-equipped machinery for such construction, reconstruction or alteration as is consistent with the provisions hereof, shall, when the boom operating height exceeds the height limitations imposed by this article require applicant to mark, or mark and light, the highest point on the boom to reflect conformity with the Federal Aviation Administration's standards for marking and lighting obstructions, and in such cases the applicant shall notify the Director of the Miami-Dade County Port Authority at least twenty-four (24) hours prior to the time that such use is to begin.
Any decision of the Director may be appealed as provided and prescribed under Article XXXVI, of Chapter 33, Code of Miami-Dade County, Florida.
</text>
<catch_line>Sec. 33-383. Nonconforming uses abandoned or destroyed</catch_line>
<text>
Whenever the Director determines that a nonconforming use, structure or tree has been abandoned or is more than fifty (50) percent burned, torn down, physically deteriorated, or decayed, no permit shall be granted for reconstruction that would permit such structure or tree to violate height limits or use standards of this article. Whether application is made for a permit under this paragraph or not, the Director, may, by appropriate action, require the owner of the nonconforming structure or tree to permit the Miami-Dade County Port Authority at its expense to lower, remove, or mark, or mark and light such object as may be necessary to conform to these regulations.
</text>
<catch_line>Sec. 33-384. Variances</catch_line>
<text>
Any person desiring to erect or increase the height of any structure, or permit the growth of any tree or otherwise use his property not in accordance with the regulations prescribed in this article may apply to the appropriate zoning board for a variance from such regulations as provided and prescribed under Article XXXVI of Chapter 33, Code of Miami-Dade County, Florida. Such variances shall be allowed where it is duly found that a literal application or enforcement of the regulations would result in practical difficulty or unnecessary hardship and the relief granted would not be contrary to the public interest but will do substantial justice and be in accordance with the spirit of this article, and such zoning board is hereby admonished that the intent and purpose of this ordinance is to promote the health, safety and general welfare of the inhabitants of Miami-Dade County, Florida, by preventing the creation or establishment of airport hazards, thereby protecting the lives and property of users of the Homestead General Aviation Airport and of occupants of land in its vicinity and preventing destruction or impairment of the utility of the airport and the public investment therein.
