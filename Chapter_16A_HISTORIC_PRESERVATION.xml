Minimum Standards for Municipal Ordinances.
<section prefix = "a">
To comply with the minimum standards for historic preservation ordinances a municipal ordinance shall contain provisions:
<section prefix = "1">
that establish a historic preservation board which shall be empowered to designate individual sites or districts and to issue certificates of appropriateness; or to advise the city commission regarding such matters. In this regard, this ordinance shall constitute authority for a municipality to delegate to its preservation board the power to designate sites and districts and issue certificates of appropriateness.
</section>
<section prefix = "2">
that provide procedures for the municipality, its staff, the Director of the Miami-Dade County Office of Historic Preservation, and private parties to recommend the initiation of designations of historic districts and individual historic sites, whether residential, commercial, industrial or other, pursuant to due notice to affected parties, legally-enforceable standards, quasi-judicial hearings, and appeals to court;
</section>
<section prefix = "3">
that protect designated sites or districts by preventing the issuance of building, construction, zoning, and demolition permits or the significant change of appearance of such sites or districts until a written certificate of appropriateness has been issued;
</section>
<section prefix = "4">
that protect property owners by procedures (1) to de-designate properties and (2) to vary or modify historic regulation based upon economic hardship pursuant to due notice to affected parties, legally-enforceable standards, quasi-judicial public hearings, and appeals to courts;
</section>
</section>
</section>
<section prefix = "5">
that provide economic incentives for preservation;

<section prefix = "6">
that regulate and prevent the demolition of historic buildings by neglect, and
</section>
<section prefix = "7">
that establish the Secretary of Interior's Standards for Rehabilitation as standards governing preservation, although a municipality may establish additional standards.
<section prefix = "b">
It is a violation of the minimum standards of this Chapter for a municipal historic preservation ordinance
<section prefix = "1">
to exempt an otherwise historic property from historic regulation or designation on the basis that the owner did not consent to the regulation or designation;
</section>
<section prefix = "2">
to allow the issuance of a permit for the demolition of a historically-regulated property unless, after a public hearing pursuant to the ordinance, a variance based upon economic hardship has been granted or a certificate of appropriateness to demolish based on express standards in the ordinance has been issued. In this regard, it is a violation of the minimum standards of this Chapter to permit the issuance of a certificate of appropriateness for demolition based solely upon the passage of a certain amount of time after the owner has applied to demolish.

Municipalities that have already enacted historic preservation ordinances as of the effective date of this ordinance shall have 365 days from the effective date of this ordinance to bring their ordinances into compliance with these minimum standards.

<section prefix = "a">
A religious property deriving primary significance from architectural or artistic distinction of historical importance.
</section>

Where a report is filed recommending designation of a district, the report must identify those properties, if any, within the district which are not historically or architecturally compatible with structures in the district.

Demolition.

Demolition of a designated building, structure, improvement or site may occur pursuant to an order of a government agency or a court of competent jurisdiction or pursuant to an approved application by the owner for a special certificate of appropriateness.
</section>
<section prefix = "b">
Government agencies having the authority to demolish unsafe structures shall receive notice of designation of individual sites, districts or archeological and paleontological zones pursuant to Section 16A-10. The staff of such agencies shall consult with the staff of the Historic Preservation Board before entering a demolition order or placing such properties on an official agenda. Such unsafe structures agencies shall not enter a demolition order unless they first determine in writing that there exists no feasible alternative to demolition. The Historic Preservation Board shall be deemed an interested party and shall receive ten days prior written notice of any public hearings conducted by said government agency regarding demolition of any designated property. The Board may make recommendations and suggestions to the government agency and the owner(s) relative to the feasibility of and the public interest in preserving the designated property. At the written request of the Director of Miami-Dade County's Office of Historic Preservation, such unsafe structure agencies shall continue any hearing on a property for not less than 30 days to allow consultation with the Miami-Dade County Historic Preservation Board. If an unsafe structures agency subjects a designated property to an order providing for demolition, the order shall also, at the written request of the Historic Preservation Board, establish a grace period of no less than 120 days to obtain a permit to repair the property, followed by no less than 180 days to complete such repairs. After entry of such a repair or demolish order, such unsafe structures agencies shall have the jurisdiction and authority to grant additional extensions of the grace period, provided the agency is satisfied that the repair will be completed in a reasonable time.
Nothing in this section shall prohibit an unsafe structures agency from entering an order requiring a designated property to be secured.

<section prefix = "c">
No permit for voluntary demolition of a designated building, structure, improvement or site shall be issued to the owner(s) thereof until an application for a special certificate of appropriateness has been submitted and approved pursuant to the procedures in this section. Refusal by the Board to grant a special certificate of appropriateness shall be evidenced by written order detailing the public interest which is sought to be preserved. The Board shall be guided by the criteria contained in part (VI), subsection (d) herein. The Board may grant a special certificate of appropriateness which may provide for a delayed effective date. The effective date shall be determined by the Board based upon the relative significance of the structure and the probable time required to arrange a possible alternative to demolition. During the demolition delay period, the Board may take such steps as it deems necessary to preserve the structure concerned, in accordance with the purposes of this chapter. Such steps may include, but shall not be limited to, consultation with civic groups, public agencies and interested citizens, recommendations for acquisition of property by public or private bodies or agencies, and exploration of the possibility of moving one (1) or more structures or other features.

In addition to all other provisions of this chapter, the Board shall consider the following criteria in evaluating applications for a special certificate of appropriateness for demolition of designated properties:

</section>
<section prefix = "4">
Does the structure contribute significantly to the historic character of a designated district?
</section>
<section prefix = "5">
Would retention of the structure promote the general welfare of the County by providing an opportunity for study of local history, architecture and design or by developing an understanding of the importance and value of a particular culture and heritage?
</section>
<section prefix = "6">
Are there definite plans for reuse of the property if the proposed demolition is carried out, and what will be the effect of those plans on the character of the surrounding area?
