In addition, in order to attract private funding for construction projects that are not in kind and that the Trust would either not otherwise undertake or would have to postpone, the Trust may accept from a not-for-profit organization whose primary purpose is to support the activities of the Trust gifts of construction projects, including the building, renovating, retrofitting, restoration, painting, altering or repairing of any Trust facility, and all services and personal property related to such construction projects, provided that each donation of such a construction project shall not exceed five million dollars ($5,000,000) and is fully funded by such not-for-profit organization. All gifts of such construction projects shall be exempt from all competitive bidding requirements and other programs otherwise mandated by the Code of Miami-Dade County for Public Health Trust contracts, provided that the not-for-profit and the contractors on the construction project agree to be bound by public records law to the same extent as a Trust contractor providing such personal property or services. The not-for-profit organization shall file a report with the Public Health Trust and Board of County Commissioners every six (6) months documenting its activities pursuant to this paragraph.
The Trust by rule or contract shall implement procedures to comply with state law requirements mandating competitive bidding for construction projects and assure that donations of specific construction projects meet all lawful requirements and Trust standards of responsibility.
