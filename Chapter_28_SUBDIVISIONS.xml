<catch_line>Sec. 28-4. Plats and plattingâRecording; exceptions</catch_line>
<text>
Whenever land is subdivided a plat must be recorded, except that the recording of a plat will not be required if:
<section prefix = "1">
The subdivision involved consists only of the dedication of a road, highway, street, alley or easement and due to unusual conditions and circumstances the plat division of the appropriate authority finds that it is not necessary that a plat be recorded. In lieu of the recording of a plat, the dedication may be required by deed, and may be subject to compliance with such conditions as may be deemed appropriate under the particular circumstances, such as improvements of sidewalks, streets, or drainage facilities and the acceptance of the dedication by the governing body. Posting of bond may be required.
</section>
<section prefix = "2">
The land to be subdivided is to be divided into no more than six (6) parcels and because of (a) unusual conditions created by ownership or development of adjacent lands, or (b) the isolation or remoteness of the land concerned in relation to other platted or improved lands, or (c) improvements and dedications existing on the land substantially in accordance with the requirements of this chapter, it is determined by the plat division of the appropriate authority that waiving of the requirement for platting would not conflict with the purpose and intent of this chapter. In lieu of platting the plat division of the appropriate authority may require any dedications, reservations, or improvements required in connection with platting under this chapter, including the posting of a performance and maintenance bond, as may be necessary to carry out the intent and purpose of this chapter.
</section>
<section prefix = "3">
The resubdivision of land heretofore platted is of such unusual size or shape, or is surrounded by such development or unusual conditions as may be determined by the plat division of the appropriate authority to justify the waiving of the requirement for recording a plat. In lieu of the recording of a plat, such conditions may be imposed as may be deemed necessary and appropriate to preserve the public interest.
</section>
<section prefix = "4">
A parcel of land conveyed by a recorded warranty deed that is dated prior to January 1, 1958, the effective date of this code; provided, however, that the parcel may be diminished in size as a result of a public dedication of any portion of that parcel.

Whenever any zoning hearing for a district boundary change within the unincorporated area is initiated by the Director of the Department of Planning and Zoning, the County Manager may order that no tentative plat or waiver of plat, pertaining to any or all property involved in the application shall be acted upon or approved until the hearing upon said application has been finally concluded in accordance with the provisions of this Code. No such order shall issue unless the County Manager first determines that the processing and approval of tentative plats and waiver of plats would create a risk of land use contrary to the zoning which is most appropriate for the area. Said order shall not prevent processing and approval of a tentative plat or waiver of plat which would be permissible if the Director's application were granted.
