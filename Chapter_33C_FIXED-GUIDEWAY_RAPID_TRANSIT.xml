Sec. 33C-1. Legislative intent, findings and purposes.
The Board of County Commissioners for Miami-Dade County, Florida, hereby declares and finds that the uncoordinated use of lands within the County threatens the orderly development and the health, safety, order, convenience, prosperity and welfare of the present and future citizens of this County. Pursuant to Ordinance No. 75-22, the Board adopted and accepted the Comprehensive Development Master Plan for Miami-Dade County whereby it specifically declared that it was the continuing policy of Miami-Dade County, in cooperation with federal, State, regional and local governments, and other concerned public and private organizations, to use all reasonable means and measures to:
<section prefix = "a">
Foster and promote the general welfare;
</section>
<section prefix = "b">
To create and maintain conditions under which man and nature can exist in productive harmony; and
</section>
<section prefix = "c">
To fill the social, economic and other requirements of the present and future generations of citizens of Miami-Dade County, Florida.

The board further found that the Comprehensive Development Master Plan was enacted to assure for all people of Miami-Dade County an attempt to create safe, healthful, productive and aesthetically and culturally pleasing surroundings; to attain the widest range of beneficial uses of the environment without unreasonable degradation, risk to the health or safety, or other undesirable and unintended consequences, to preserve important historic, cultural and natural aspects of our national heritage; to maintain, wherever possible, an environment which supports diversity and variety of individual choice; to achieve a balance between population and resources which will permit the high standards of living and a wide sharing of life's amenities, and to enhance the quality of renewal resources and approach the maximum attainable recycling of depletable resources. In furtherance of these goals and objectives, the Board finds that the coordinated review and analysis of its mass transit facilities is necessary to carry on a central metropolitan government in Miami-Dade County, Florida. Coordinated review and analysis of the mass transit system is susceptible to, and would be most effectively carried on, under a uniform plan of regulation applicable to the County as a whole. The planning of major transportation facilities, combined with other plan implementation tools, can be effectively used in meeting social, economic and environmental needs and in creating a major influence on metropolitan development patterns and life styles. The capability of a transportation network, acting in conjunction with other urban services to establish general development trends, is well recognized. A maximum coordination of transportation and land use policy decisions is therefore essential to optimize the role of transportation as a potent tool for implementing the desired patterns of metropolitan development.
The Board further finds that the Stage I Fixed-Guideway Rapid Transit System has, since 1973, undergone extensive planning, review, analysis, and engineering design efforts. The Stage I System has received design approval from both the federal and State governments and is in the process of final design, procurement and construction activities. The Stage I System, including proposed improvements in other forms of surface transportation facilities, represents a concerted, coordinated effort to improve not only the transportation facilities within Miami-Dade County, but the overall quality of life enjoyed by citizens of and visitors to Miami-Dade County. Finally, the Stage I System represents one (1) of the largest public works projects ever undertaken in Miami-Dade County and the Southeastern United States. As such, the Stage I Fixed-Guideway Rapid Transit System may only be planned, engineered, implemented, and administered on a County-wide basis, in a manner which will:
<section prefix = "a">
Provide maximum opportunities for development to serve as financial assistance to the system; and
</section>
<section prefix = "b">
Provide incentives for joint development with the private sector.

County government office development in the Rapid Transit Zone within municipalities. Whenever County office development is proposed for that portion of the Rapid Transit Zone surrounding the Douglas Road Metrorail Station, the directors of the Departments of Planning and Zoning, the Miami-Dade Transit Agency and the department proposing the development shall develop proposed master plan development standards for such proposed uses. The standards shall contain, at a minimum: (a) maximum height of the building; (b) maximum floor area ratio; (c) maximum parking provided; (d) minimum open space; (e) minimum setbacks from property lines; (f) gross and net land area; (g) criteria for pedestrian and vehicular circulation systems; (h) signage criteria; (i) criteria for parking layouts and drives; and (j) features demonstrating conformity with the guidelines for development of urban centers contained in the Comprehensive Development Master Plan, conformity with the Miami-Dade County Urban Design Manual, and consistency with the Metrorail Compendium of Design Criteria. Upon the consent of the county manager, the proposed standards shall be submitted to the affected municipality's governing board for review and approval.
In reviewing the standards, the municipality shall consider the type of function involved, the public need therefor, the existing land use pattern in the area and the nature of the impact of the facility on the surrounding property. The municipal governing board shall have the power to approve or reject the standards, but shall not modify the standards as submitted. Unless extended by agreement with the County Manager, failure of the municipal governing board to reach a final decision on the proposed development standards within 60 days after receipt of the standards may be deemed by the County to be a lack of objection to the standards as proposed. If the municipal governing board rejects the proposed development standards, the proposed County office development shall not be permitted at the site unless the Board of County Commissioners determines after duly noticed public hearing that the proposed development is of County-wide necessity and significance, and upon such determination approves the development standards in accordance with the criteria applicable to the municipal governing board.
After approval of the development standards, a site plan consistent with the approved development standards shall be submitted to the Director of the Department of Planning and Zoning. After review by the Directors of the Departments of Planning and Zoning, the Miami-Dade Transit Agency and the department seeking development approval, the County Manager may submit the site plan to the Board of County Commissioners with a recommendation for approval.
The Board of County Commissioners may authorize the development and approve the site plan by resolution following public hearing. The public hearing shall be held upon 15 days' notice of the time and place of the hearing published in a newspaper of general circulation in Miami-Dade County, which publication shall include the time and place of hearing before the Board of County Commissioners. A courtesy notice containing general information as to the date, time and place of the hearing, the property location and general nature of the proposed development may be mailed to the property owners of record within a radius of three hundred (300) feet of the property described in the application, or such greater distance as the County Manager may provide; provided, however, that failure to mail or receive such courtesy notice shall not affect any action or proceeding taken hereunder. To provide additional notice to the public, the property may be posted by a sign or signs indicating the action desired and the time and place of public hearing thereon. Failure to post the property shall not affect any action taken hereunder. At the public hearing, the Board shall consider, among other factors, the type of function involved, the public need therefor, the existing land use pattern in the area, alternative locations for the facility and the nature of the impact of the development on the surrounding property.
This process shall apply only to that portion of the Rapid Transit Zone surrounding the Douglas Road Metrorail Station.
