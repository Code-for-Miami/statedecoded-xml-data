In the case of development activity involving a change of use and/or magnitude of use in which a building permit is required, the proposed development shall be required to pay an impact fee only for any increase in the development activity. The impact fee shall be the difference between the computed impact fee for the proposed development activity and the computed impact fee for the existing development activity as defined in Section 33E-5. Any building permit which expires or is revoked after the effective date of this chapter and for which a fee has not previously been paid under this chapter shall be required to comply with the provisions herein. No refunds will be given for proposed development activity resulting in a negative fee calculation.

<catch_line>Sec. 33E-9. Fee computation by independent study</catch_line>
<text>
The feepayer may elect, either prior to or subsequent to paying the scheduled impact fee (Section 33E-8), to utilize an independent fee computation study pursuant to the formula set forth in Section 33E-7(a). The feepayer shall provide the County Public Works Director notice of intent to utilize an independent fee computation study prior to, but no later than, the time of application for a building permit. All such studies initiated after the issuance of a building permit shall be completed and submitted to the Public Works Director within six (6) months of issuance of building permit. Nothing within this section shall allow a building permit for development activity to be issued without the payment of a roadway impact fee as provided for in Section 33E-6 herein.
<section prefix = "a">
If the feepayer elects to utilize an independent fee computation study, the feepayer shall, at his own expense, prepare and present to the County Public Works Director such a study that shall document the basis upon which the value of each of the components of the fee formula set forth in Section 33E-7(a) was determined. The feepayer shall follow the impact fee study methodology contained in the impact fee manual. Subjects of the study shall include the following unless determined otherwise by the Public Works Director:
<section prefix = "1">
Trip generation rates;

Should the County Public Works Director determine that the conditions described in Section 33E-9(c) are not fully met by the independent fee study he shall issue a letter to the applicant stating the deficiencies and his intent to reject the independent fee calculation study unless the deficiencies are corrected. If the County Public Works Director determines that the deficiencies in the independent fee study have not been corrected within sixty (60) working days from the date of the letter of intent, he shall issue a letter rejecting the independent fee study.

<catch_line>Sec. 33E-10. Roadway improvement contributions in-lieu-of-fee</catch_line>
<text>
<section prefix = "a">
In lieu of payment of all or part of the road impact fee, the County Public Works Director may accept the offer of a feepayer to construct all or part of an off-site roadway improvement. All contributions in-lieu-of-fee shall be in accordance with the Comprehensive Development Master Plan and the short range transportation improvement program. Such contributions in-lieu-of-fee shall be credited against payment of an impact fee in the amount determined by the County Public Works Director pursuant to Sections 33E-8 or 33E-9. The total amount of contributions in-lieu-of-fee shall not exceed the road cost portion of the impact fee formula in Section 33E-7. Contributions in-lieu-of-fee shall not be applied to the two (2) percent County administrative cost portion of the impact fee which shall remain the responsibility of the feepayer and must be paid at the time of building permit issuance.
Where a feepayer seeks to apply a contribution in-lieu-of-fee credit against payment of the road impact fee, the administrative fee portion of the impact fee shall be the sum of: (a) two (2) percent of the contribution in-lieu-of-fee or one thousand dollars ($1,000.00) whichever is less and (b) two (2) percent of the remaining road cost not satisfied by the contribution in-lieu-of fee.
Previously approved contributions in-lieu-of-fees which are: (1) unused and (2) based on a net road cost which has been subsequently adjusted, shall be entitled to an adjustment equal to the percentage increase or decrease of the net road cost in the road impact fee formula. Previously approved contributions in-lieu-of-fees which are: (1) unused and (2) based on a road cost which has been subsequently adjusted, shall be entitled to an adjustment equal to the percentage increase or decrease of the road cost in the road impact fee formula. Any such adjustment shall only be utilized to offset road impact fees and shall not be refundable.
</section>
<section prefix = "b">
An offer by a feepayer to construct road improvement contributions in-lieu-of-fee must be accompanied by plans in sufficient detail to permit the County Public Works Director to determine that County or State design standards will be used and to determine the cost of such improvements.
</section>
<section prefix = "c">
The County Public Works Director may accept or reject an offer of contributions in-lieu-of-fee. When such improvements are not consistent with standards set forth in the impact fee manual the Public Works Director may reject the offer of contributions in-lieu-of-fee. If rejected, the Public Works Director shall state in writing the reasons for the rejection. Any appeal from such a decision of the County Public Works Director to reject improvement contributions in-lieu-of-fee shall be reviewed by the County Development Impact Committee Executive Council pursuant to the procedures set forth in the adopted impact fee manual.
</section>
<section prefix = "d">
If the County Public Works Director accepts an offer of contributions in-lieu-of-fee, the feepayer shall post a bond or letter of credit with the County Planning and Zoning Director equal to one hundred ten (110) percent of the cost of the agreed to improvement as determined by the County Public Works Director. Upon receipt of such bond, the appropriate County or City entity may issue building permits for that part of the proposed development determined by the County to be satisfied by the contributions in-lieu-of-fee. Release of such bonds for contributions in-lieu-of-fee shall not be issued by either the County or city until such contributed improvements have been completed and accepted by the County Public Works Director or the State.
</section>
<section prefix = "e">
If pursuant to Section 33E-10(a) and 33E-10(b), the County Public Works Director accepts improvements with a cost in excess of the impact fee computed pursuant to Section 33E-8 or Section 33E-9 herein, the feepayer, upon written request, shall be reimbursed for the amount of the excess cost as said cost is determined by the Public Works Director pursuant to Section 33E-10 of this chapter. It shall be the burden of the feepayer to make a written request for reimbursement at the time of building permit application. The feepayer shall only be eligible for reimbursement after such time as the improvement is completed and accepted by County Public Works Director or the State. Reimbursements shall be made from available monies existing within the corresponding benefit district trust fund. No reimbursement shall be made after six (6) years from the date of first building permit issuance.
</section>
<section prefix = "f">
Any provisions for contributions in lieu of road impact fees included as a condition of a development of regional impact development order must be approved by the County Public Works Director prior to approval of the final development order for county development orders or subsequently ratified by the County Public Works Director in the case of municipal development orders.
</section>
<section prefix = "g">
Any claim for contributions in lieu of road impact fee shall have been submitted to and received approval from the County Public Works Director prior to issuance of any building permit intended to use said contributions in lieu of fee and prior to commencement of any road construction or dedication of any right-of-way for which said contributions in lieu of fee are being claimed.
</section>
<section prefix = "h">
Authorized contributions in lieu of fees are not site-transferable and may only be applied against the impact fees due for developments within the parent tract (development property) of the application for which the off-site contributions were made and authorized. Allocations of contributions in lieu of fees to sub-parcels within the parent tract shall be on based on the prorated area (square footage or acreage) unless an alternative allocation or reallocation has been approved by the County Public Works Director.
</section>
<section prefix = "i">
The fee payer shall pay a nonrefundable administrative cost in the amount set forth in the road impact fee manual to be used by the county for processing and review of the contributions in lieu of fee study. This fee shall not be credited against the amount of road impact fees due.
<section prefix = "k">
Determination of the amount of contributions in lieu of road impact fees to be accepted shall be determined by the County Public Works Director based on a review of the documentation provided by the feepayer and current cost information. Any increase in this amount due to changes in construction plans must be authorized in advance by the Public Works Director.
</section>
<section prefix = "l">
Previously approved contributions in lieu of fee that have not yet been used may be re-adjusted based on the percentage increase or decrease in the net-road cost as recalculated pursuant to Section 33E-7. Any such adjustment may be applied toward payment of road impact fees but shall not be refundable.

Funds from the roadway impact fee trust funds, including any accrued interest, shall be used only in accordance with Section 33E-11 for the purpose of financing roadway capacity improvements incorporated into the Miami-Dade County Metropolitan Planning Organization's adopted long range transportation plan or short range transportation improvement program, except that an amount not to exceed three (3) percent of the gross receipts shall be used by Miami-Dade County to offset the cost of administering the provisions of this chapter.
</section>
<section prefix = "b">
Highest priority for impact fee trust account expenditures shall be for roadway capacity improvements deemed by the Miami-Dade County Metropolitan Planning Organization (MPO) as most needed to serve new development. Such determination by the MPO shall consider recommendation from a joint County/municipal committee as provided for in the Metro-Miami-Dade road impact fee manual. This recommendation is not limited to only County or State designated roadways, but may include municipal roads and select transit capital improvements pursuant to subsection 33E-12 (d). Before funds can be allocated or expended for any capacity enhancement projects on local roads within any one Road Impact Fee District, funding for all programmed capacity needs for County arterial and collector roadways, and municipal collector roadways, within said District must have been identified and encumbered, as determined by the Miami-Dade County Public Works Director. Trust account funds shall be deemed expended in the order in which they are collected. Policies to be used in scheduling the expenditure of impact fee trust funds through the long range transportation plan and short range transportation improvement program shall be set forth in the impact fee manual.
The County may construct or provide any of the roadway improvement elements listed above or alternatively may contract with a municipality to construct or provide such elements with road impact fees.
