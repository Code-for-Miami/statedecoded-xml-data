The intermediate development orders, except for commercial quarry permits and permits for rock plowing or wetland permitting for agricultural uses not involving structures, shall include a notice to the applicant that the subject approval does not constitute a final development order and that one (1) or more subsequent concurrency determinations will be required. Such notice shall include conditions that ensure the availability of adequate infrastructure to serve the proposed development as required in Section 33G-5(6)(c). Such conditions shall be binding, and no final development order shall be approved until these conditions have been met or modified by the County board, agency, or department which established same so long as said modification does not result in lowering the LOS below the LOS standard. Intermediate development orders shall also include a listing of any service impact mitigation measures which the applicant agree to provide or utilize and which shall also become a condition of the final development orders.
</section>
<section prefix = "3">
A concurrency statement issued in association with the intermediate development order and based upon conditions enumerated in the development order pursuant to Section 33G-5(6)(b)2., requires reservation of that portion of the available capacity necessary to accommodate the impact of the development until the final plat is approved or for twelve (12) months from the date of the earliest tentative plat approval, whichever occurs first, provided that the tentative plat remains valid. Where any tentative plat approved after December 31, 1998, includes one or more lakes required to be excavated in conformity with the requirements of either the North Trail Basin Fill Encroachment and Water Management Criteria or the Bird Drive Everglades Basin Fill Encroachment and Water Management Criteria the reservation of that portion of the available capacity necessary to accommodate the impact of the development may be extended for an additional six (6) months from the date of the earliest tentative plat approval, provided that application for such extension is made prior to the expiration of the first twelve months and provided further that the tentative plat remains valid thereafter. Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, the actual period of lake excavation shall not exceed twelve (12) months. Such statement may also serve as the concurrency statement required for issuance of final development orders for the subject development provided that: (a) all the conditions for ensuring the availability of adequate infrastructure to serve the proposed development as required in Section 33G-5(6)(c) and as specified in the intermediate development order are satisfied at the time the intermediate development order is issued; (b) the tentative plat has remained valid; (c) the development proposal for which the final development order is requested remains substantially unchanged; and (d) the application for the final development order is approved within twelve (12) months of the date of the original tentative plat approval or within eighteen (18) months of the date of the original tentative plat approval of any tentative plat approved after December 31, 1998, which includes one or more lakes to be excavated in conformity with the requirements of either the North Trail Basin Fill Encroachment and Water Management Criteria or the Bird Drive Everglades Basin Fill Encroachment and Water Management Basin Criteria. Notwithstanding other provisions of this chapter, if the foregoing provisions of this paragraph have been met, a final development order will be issued, without any further concurrency review. Upon such issuance, the two-year period specified in Section 33G-5(6)(c)4. shall commence as of the date of the approval of the final plat by the Board of County Commissioners.

An application to modify a valid tentative plat that has been approved pursuant to Section 33G-5(6)(b)1. or an application to replat a final plat that has been approved pursuant to Section 33G-5(6)(b)3. shall be approved for concurency where one or more services are operating below the LOS standards provided that the application is made within the respective one- or two-year reservation period as established in Section 33G-5(6)(b)3. and 33G-5(6)(c)4. and that the applicable concurrency review agency states in writing that the proposed impact on the substandard service will be no greater than that of the impact of the existing valid development order.
