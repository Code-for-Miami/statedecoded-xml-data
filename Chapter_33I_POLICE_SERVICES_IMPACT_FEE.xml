This chapter [Ordinance Number 90-31] shall be known and may be cited as the "Police Services Impact Fee Ordinance."

<catch_line>Sec. 33I-2. Findings, conclusions and purpose</catch_line>
<text>
<section prefix = "a">
The provision of adequate police protection is essential for the safety of the public. The existing level of service in Miami-Dade County provides for the prompt dispatch of police assistance of a size and composition appropriate to the request and with an emergency response time of within five (5) minutes for the first arriving unit.
</section>
<section prefix = "b">
Increase in new development in unincorporated Miami-Dade County will directly and adversely impact existing police services. In order to maintain adequate police protection for the existing population and to accommodate projected population due to new development, additional capital resources are required.
</section>
<section prefix = "c">
Current sources of revenue will be inadequate to fund the cost of acquisition of property and capital equipment required to provide police service to new development. Without an impact fee, the adverse impact on existing and future residents of unincorporated Miami-Dade County will result.
</section>
<section prefix = "d">
Nothing in this chapter shall prohibit or restrict funding of law enforcement related land, facilities and capital equipment from additional revenue sources to enhance police services.

If a building permit encompassing feepaying development expires or is revoked, or if the feepayer has paid impact fees in excess of the amount determined by an approved independent fee computation study completed in accordance with conditions set forth in Section 33I-9, then the feepayer may request from the Director of the Department of Planning and Zoning a refund of the impact fee paid or the appropriate portion thereof. However, the County shall retain the general administrative cost portion of the fee to cover the cost of the administration of the impact fee calculation, collection and refund. The feepayer must submit an application for such refund to the Director of the Department of Planning and Zoning within thirty (30) days of notification of any of the enumerated circumstances. No refund shall be provided for impact fees deemed expended pursuant to Section 33I-11(c) if no timely claim was made. Funds shall be deemed expended for the purposes of this chapter when a contract or agreement encumbering all or a portion of the payment of said funds shall be approved by final County action. No refunds of police services impact fees shall be given for proposed development activity which results in a negative impact fee computation.

Any impact fee trust funds not expended by the end of the fiscal quarter immediately following six (6) years from the date that the fee was paid shall be returned to the feepayer by the Director of the Department of Planning and Zoning with accrued interest; provided, however, that this subsection shall not apply to developments of regional impact with phased or long term buildout.
