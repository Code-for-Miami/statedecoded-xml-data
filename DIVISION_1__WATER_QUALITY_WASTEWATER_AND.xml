EFFLUENT STANDARDS FOR MIAMI-DADE COUNTY. All sewage treatment plants and industrial waste treatment plants (except those discharging to approved ocean outfalls) shall effect ninety (90) percent treatment or better at the defined sampling point (24-44.2(1)). However, in no case shall the following effluent standards be exceeded (except where the standard is noted to be a minimum).

<section prefix = "a">
Each publicly or privately owned or operated sanitary sewer collection system shall be evaluated in order to identify and reduce infiltration and inflow into the sanitary sewer collection system. The person responsible for the sewer system's operation shall implement a sewer system evaluation survey (SSES) and, if required, a rehabilitation program, incorporating the provisions and requirements set forth in the U.S. EPA's Sewer System Infrastructure Analysis and Rehabilitation Handbook (October 1991, EPA/625/6-91/030), designed to identify and reduce sewer system infiltration and inflow to a level which meets the standards set forth in Section 24-42.2(1)(d). Such evaluation activities shall be conducted in a manner so that the total length of the gravity sewer lines and associated manholes in the sanitary sewer collection system is evaluated during the first five-year period of the program, and every ten-year period thereafter. Alternatively, the person responsible for the sewer system's operation shall, within forty-five (45) days after the effective date of this section, submit to the Director or the Director's designee for the Director's or the Director's designee's review and approval a report which provides a detailed description of a sewer system evaluation survey and rehabilitation program which incorporates the provisions and requirements set forth in the U.S. EPA's Sewer System Infrastructure Analysis and Rehabilitation Handbook (October, 1991 EPA/626/6-91/030) and which, when implemented, provides effective and substantial compliance with the requirements of this section of the Code. Said report shall include, in addition to any of the above requirements, decision making criteria, procedures and protocols for prioritization of the evaluation of gravity sewer lines and associated manholes, and for the selection of rehabilitation methods to be used. Upon its approval, the program shall be implemented in a manner so that the sewer system evaluation survey is conducted on the total length of the gravity sewer lines and associated manholes during the first five-year period of the program and every ten-year period thereafter. For purpose of compliance with either alternative, infiltration and inflow evaluations and rehabilitation work performed between July 1, 1992 and the effective date of this section can be credited towards the first five-year requirements provided the person responsible for the sewer system's operation submits to the Director or the Director's designee, for the Director's or the Director's designee's review and approval, a report detailing the work performed and the results obtained as required under Section 24-42.2(1)(f)(iv).

Where an evaluation pursuant to Section 24-42.2(1)(a) above indicates that a privately owned portion of a sewage lateral connection is a source of infiltration or inflow, or both, to a publicly or privately owned or operated sanitary sewer, the owner or operator of the sanitary sewer collection system shall report to the Director or the Director's designee the source of the infiltration or inflow within thirty (30) days from the date of discovery of said discharges. The Director or the Director's designee shall commence enforcement actions, if required, to cause the cessation of the infiltration or inflow.

Notwithstanding any other provision in this section, all publicly owned or operated sanitary sewer collection systems shall participate in a County-wide, regional rainfall dependent peak flow management study.

Upon implementation of a peak flow management study the person responsible for the operation of the publicly owned or operated sanitary sewer collection system shall submit to the Director or the Director's designee the results of said study along with a plan of corrective actions and schedule of implementation for each and every pump station within the sanitary sewer collection system which was identified as not capable of managing peak flows with the back-up pump out-of-service.

The sewer system infiltration and inflow rehabilitation programs shall be sufficient to insure that sewer system infiltration and inflow into the rehabilitated sanitary sewer collection system shall be less than five thousand (5,000) gallons per inch pipe diameter per day per mile of pipe and laterals, or complies with best management practices as required by the U.S. EPA's Sewer System Infrastructure Analysis and Rehabilitation Handbook (October 1991, EPA/625/6-91/030).

In the event that implementation of the initial sewer system infiltration and inflow rehabilitation programs fail to achieve the performance standards established in this section, the person responsible for the system's operation may, in lieu of performing additional rehabilitation, submit a cost-benefit analysis which analyzes the feasibility of performing additional rehabilitation to achieve said performance standards.
