</section>
<section prefix = "2">
CLEAN-UP TARGET LEVELS (CTLs) AND PROCEDURES FOR SITES OR CONTAMINANTS OTHER THAN THOSE IDENTIFIED IN SECTION 24-44(1).
<section prefix = "a">
Intent. To protect human health, public safety and environmental resources using risk-based corrective action strategies and to establish the point at which a site rehabilitation action is determined to be accomplished.
</section>
<section prefix = "b">
The acceptable level of protection for the establishment of human health based CTLs shall be a lifetime excess cancer risk level of one in one million (1.0E-06) and a hazard quotient of one (1) or less. In addition, the CTLs shall be established to protect aquatic life and to prevent nuisance conditions as applicable.
</section>
<section prefix = "c">
Applicability. The CTLs set forth in this section are not effluent standards and are not for the purpose of disposal or reuse.
The CTLs and SRA procedures set forth in this section shall not apply to those contaminants that are subject to the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980 as amended by the Superfund Amendments and Reauthorization Act of 1986, the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, the federal Hazardous and Solid Waste Amendments of 1984, or the Toxic Substance Control Act of 1976.
In addition, the soil CTLs set forth in Section 24-44(2)(f)(v)2. shall not apply to contaminants in soil that are present as a result of the application of registered pesticides that were applied in accordance with state and federal law and the EPA approved applicable registered labels. In making a determination of the applicability of CTLs pursuant to this provision, the party or parties responsible for SRAs shall provide records substantiating such pesticide applications to the Department upon request. Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of Section 24-44(2)(b), if groundwater contains contaminants above the groundwater CTLs set forth in Section 24-44(2)(f)(v)1. as a result of the pesticide application, then the CTLs and SRA procedures set forth in Section 24-44(2) shall apply.
</section>
<section prefix = "d">
Party or parties responsible for site rehabilitation actions shall be the discharger or, if the discharger is unknown or the contamination was the result of a previously unreported discharge, the property owner or operator who is subject to the provisions of Section 24-44(2).
</section>
<section prefix = "e">
Retroactivity. The CTLs and the SRA procedures set forth herein shall not apply to those contaminants for which, on or before the effective date of this ordinance, a no further action plan, a source removal plan, a remedial action plan or a monitoring only plan has been approved in writing by the Director, or the Director's designee, unless the party or parties responsible for SRAs have failed to comply with the conditions of the plan approval. However, the party or parties responsible for SRAs may elect to complete site rehabilitation as provided in Section 24-44(2).
</section>
<section prefix = "f">
The Clean-up Target Levels are as follows:
<section prefix = "i">
The groundwater and surface water CTLs are set forth in Section 24-44(2)(f)(v)1. The groundwater CTLs are equivalent to the numerical standards set forth in Section 24-43.3(2)(h) of this chapter. For contaminants not listed in Section 24-43.3(2)(h), the groundwater CTLs are equivalent to the numerical standards set forth in Chapter 62-550, F.A.C., Table 1, Table 2, Table 3, Table 4, Table 5 and Table 6, as same may be amended from time to time.
For contaminants not listed in Section 24-43.3(2)(h) or Chapter 62-550, F.A.C., Table 1, Table 2, Table 3, Table 4, Table 5 and Table 6, as same may be amended from time to time, groundwater CTLs are based upon the protection of human health and the prevention of nuisance conditions as set forth in Section 24-44(2)(b). The groundwater CTLs have been established using the procedures, equations and input parameters set forth in the DERM Technical Report: "Development of Clean-up Target Levels (CTLs) for Chapter 24 of the Code of Miami-Dade County, Florida" (dated September, 2005).
The surface water CTLs are equivalent to the water quality standards set forth in Section 24-42(4) of this chapter.
For contaminants not listed in Section 24-42(4), the surface water CTLs are based upon the protection of human health and aquatic life and the prevention of nuisance conditions as set forth in Section 24-44(2)(b). The surface water CTLs have been established using the procedures, equations and input parameters set forth in the DERM Technical Report: "Development of Clean-up Target Levels (CTLs) for Chapter 24 of the Code of Miami-Dade County, Florida" (dated September, 2005) and, as applicable, the numerical standards set forth in Chapter 62-302, F.A.C, as same may be amended from time to time.
Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of Section 24-44(2)(f)(i), no groundwater or surface water CTLs shall be more stringent than the practical quantitation limits or naturally occurring background concentrations determined in a natural background concentration study which has been approved by the Director or the Director's designee.
</section>
<section prefix = "ii">
The soil CTLs are set forth in Section 24-44(2)(f)(v)2.. The soil CTLs are based upon the protection of human health as set forth in Section 24-44(2)(b) and groundwater and surface water CTLs set forth in Section 24-44(2)(f)(v)1.. The soil CTLs have been established using the procedures, equations and input parameters set forth in the DERM Technical Report: "Development of Clean-up Target Levels (CTLs) for Chapter 24 of the Code of Miami-Dade County, Florida" (dated September, 2005).
However, the applicable leachability-based soil CTLs may be exceeded if it is demonstrated to the satisfaction of the Director, or the Director's designee, that:
<section prefix = "1">
Leachate concentrations do not exceed the applicable groundwater or surface water CTLs set forth in Section 24-44(2)(f)(v)1., using a laboratory leaching procedure which simulates soil leachability and which has been approved by the Director or the Director's designee; or
</section>
<section prefix = "2">
For soil that is and has been exposed to the elements (i.e., open ground, not covered by impermeable or semi-permeable cover) and subject to infiltration throughout the entire unsaturated zone for a minimum of two years, it has been subsequently demonstrated to the satisfaction of the Director, or the Director's designee, by a minimum of one year of groundwater monitoring data, that contaminants will not leach into the groundwater at concentrations that exceed the applicable groundwater or surface water CTLs set forth in Section 24-44(2)(f)(v)1.. This demonstration shall consider site-specific characteristics such as the thickness of the unsaturated zone, depth and mass of soil contaminants, soil lithology, actual precipitation, concentration gradients, and the chemical and physical characteristics of the contaminants.
Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of Section 24-44(2)(f)(ii), no soil CTLs shall be more stringent than the practical quantitation limits or naturally occurring background concentrations determined in a natural background concentration study which has been approved by the Director or the Director's designee.
</section>
</section>
<section prefix = "iii">
The Director, or the Director's designee, may approve alternative CTLs provided that: human health, public safety, and the environment are afforded equivalent protection to that provided in Section 24-44 (2)(f)(i) and Section 24-44(2)(f)(ii); and same are based upon one (1) of the following, or a combination of the following:
<section prefix = "1">
The application of the procedures set forth in Section 24-44 (2)(k)(ii) or Section 24-44(2)(1)(ii).
</section>
<section prefix = "2">

CTLs are expressed in units of ug/l (ppb).
# = These default Target Organ(s)/Systems or Effects are those reported to occur at the doses used to derive the referenced dose. Non-default Target Organ(s)/Systems or Effects may be justified through a detailed toxicological analysis of the chemicals present at a specific site.
* = There are no surface water standards for these individual polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons. Per Chapter 62-302, F.A.C., the surface water criterion for PolycyclicAromatic Hydrocarbons (PAHs) shall apply to the total concentration of Acenaphthylene, Benzo(a)anthracene, Benzo(a)pyrene, Benzo(fluoranthene, Benzo(g,i,h) perylene, Benzo(k)fluoranthene, Chrysene, Dibenzo(a,h,)anthracene, Indenol(1,2,3-cd)pyrene, and Phenanthrene.
** = Groundwater CTLs for Class C carcinogens with no cancer slope factor were developed using the referenced dose divided by a factor of 10, as described in the DERM Technical Report: Development of Cleanup Target Levels (CTLs) for Chapter 24, of the Code of Miami-Dade County (September 2005).
(a) = Freshwater surface water criterion for Ammonia based on un-ionized ammonia only. All other water criteria for ammonia are based on total ammonia.
(b) = The common name BHC is a misnomer for Hexachlorocyclohexane.
(c) = Criteria for Dioxins, as total 2,3,7,8-TCDD equivalents shall be compared to the total dioxin equivalents for chlorinated dioxin and dibenzofuran congeners using the approach set forth in the DERM Technical Report: Development of Cleanup Target Levels (CTLs) for Chapter 24 of the Code of Miami-Dade County (September 2005).
(d) = Surface water values protective of human health for Vinyl chloride calculated assuming continuous lifetime exposure from birth as described in the DERM Technical Report: Development of Cleanup Target Levels (CTLs) for Chapter 24 of the Code of Miami-Dade County (September 2005).
(e) = Not to exceed 10% above ambient, as set forth in Sec. 24-42(4).
(f) = Hardness-dependent as set forth in Chapter 62-302, F.A.C.
(g) = Criteria for these metals are measured as total recoverable metal. However, they may be applied as dissolved metals when, as part of a permit application, a dissolved metals translator has been established according to the procedures set forth in the document, "Guidance for Establishing a Metals Translator", Florida Department of Environmental Protection, December 17, 2001.
(h) = In the absence of concentration data specific for the III and VI valence states of chromium, total chromium concentrations in surface water shall be compared to the criteria for Chromium (hexavalent).
(i) = 12789-03-6 or 57-74-9
NA = Not available.
None Specified = Target organ(s) not available.
Note: Freshwater and marine surface waters, and groundwater at the point of discharge into surface water shall pass acute and chronic toxicity bioassay tests: The user shall consult the standard definitions for acute and chronic toxicity set forth in F.A.C. 62-302.200(1) and F.A.C. 62-302.200(4), respectively.

CTLs are expressed in units of mg/kg (ppm) on a dry weight basis and rounded to two significant figures if >1 and to one significant figure if <1.
# = These default Target Organ(s)/Systems or Effects are those reported to occur at the doses used to derive the referenced dose. Non-default Target Organ(s)/Systems or Effects may be justified through a detailed toxicological analysis of the chemicals present at a specific site.
* Contaminant is not a health concern for this exposure scenario.
** Direct exposure value based on acute toxicity considerations. This criterion is applicable in scenarios where children might be exposed to soils (e.g. residences, schools, playgrounds).
*** Leachability values may be derived using the SPLP Test to calculate site-specific SCTLs or may be determined using TCLP in the event oily wastes are present.
## = Site concentrations for carcinogenic polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons shall be converted to Benzo(a)pyrene equivalents before comparison with the appropriate direct exposure SCTL for Benzo(a)pyrene using the approach described in the DERM Technical Report: Development of Cleanup Target Levels (CTLs) for Chapter 24, of the Code of Miami-Dade County (September 2005).
(a) = See discussion on the development of SCTLs for Ammonia in the DERM Technical Report: Development of Cleanup Target Levels (CTLs) for Chapter 24 of the Code of Miami-Dade County (September 2005).
(b) = Leachability values derived from USEPA Soil Screening Guidance (1996). These values were derived assuming soil pH 6.8. These leachability values are dependent upon both the metal concentration in soil and soil characteristics. Thus, if site-specific soil characteristics are different than the defaults, these leachability values may not apply. If this is the case, site-specific leachability values may be derived using methods such as TCLP or SPLP.
(c) = Phytotoxicity must be considered.
(d) = Residential direct exposure value from USEPA Revised Interim Soil Guidance for CERCLA Sites and RCRA Corrective Action Facilities. OSWER Directive 9355.4-12 (1994). The industrial direct exposure value was derived using methodologies set forth in USEPA "Recommendations of the Technical Review Workgroup for Lead for an Interim Approach to Assessing Risks Associated with Adult Exposures to Lead in Soil', December 1996; and in 'Blood Lead Concentrations of U.S. Adult Females: Summary Statistics from Phases 1 and 2 of the NHANES III', March 2002.
(e) = The SCTL for Dioxins, as total 2,3,7,8-TCDD equivalents should be compared to the total dioxin equivalents for chlorinated dioxin and dibenzofuran congeners using the approach described in the DERM Technical Report: Development of Cleanup Target Levels (CTLs) for Chapter 24 of the Code of Miami-Dade County (September 2005).
(f) = The common name BHC is a misnomer for hexachlorocyclohexane.
(g) = Unless concentratons for both chromium III and VI are known, total chromium concentrations may be compared with direct exposures SCTLs for chromium VI.
(h) = Residential chronic SCTL for cadmium shall be used as a not-to-exceed value because the residential chronic SCTL for cadmium is indistinguishable from the SCTL based on acute toxicity.
(i) = Residential chronic SCTL for vinyl chloride calculated by adding prorated and non-prorated risks, as discussed in the DERM Technical Report: Development of Cleanup Target Levels (CTLs) for Chapter 24 of the Code of Miami-Dade County (September 2005).
(j) = 12789-03-6 or 57-74-9
(k) = Hardness-dependent fresh surface water CTLs shall be calculated using the site-specific hardness prior to calculating the leachcability based upon fresh surface water CTLs or comparing the SPLP leachate concentrations.
None Specified = Target organ(s) not determined.
NA = Not available.
