Approval of this provision by the County Commission shall constitute approval of the necessary rate increase for the Miami-Dade Water and Sewer Department pursuant to Chapter 32A.
Payment of the fee to the County shall be accompanied by a statement verified by the utility showing its receipts upon which such fee is computed. This statement shall be in such form as the Director shall prescribe and shall be subject to audit by the County.
