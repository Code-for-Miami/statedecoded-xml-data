It shall be unlawful for a seller or distributor of mini bikes, being motor-driven cycles as defined in Section 30-1(22) [now 30-202(23)], Code of Miami-Dade County, Florida, or go-carts, being motor vehicles as defined in Section 30-1(23) [now 30-202(21)], Code of Miami-Dade County, Florida, to display or advertise such products misleadingly as to create the impression that such vehicle may be operated at any place within Miami-Dade County, whether or not on private property, by a person who does not have a valid operator's license, or that the vehicle may be operated at any place within Miami-Dade County if the vehicle does not possess the required motor vehicle inspection certificate. All such advertisements or displays shall contain the following words: "It is unlawful to operate this vehicle at any place within Miami-Dade County, whether or not on private property, if the operator does not have a valid operator's license to operate a motor vehicle, as required by Section 30-13 [now 30-213(2)], Code of Miami-Dade County, Florida; if the vehicle does not possess the State inspection certificate, as required by Section 30-119 [now 30-390] of the Code of Miami-Dade County, Florida; and it is unlawful to operate this vehicle on any street in the County, if the vehicle is not licensed in accordance with State law; or if the operator is not wearing a safety helmet or shield as required by law."

It shall also be unlawful for any seller of a mini bike or go-cart as defined, or like vehicle, to sell such vehicle without having first obtained a signed statement from the purchaser which includes therein the words: "I have been informed that it is unlawful to operate this vehicle at any place within Miami-Dade County, whether or not on private property, if the operator does not have a valid operator's license to operate a motor vehicle, as required by Section 30-13 [now 30-213(2)], Code of Miami-Dade County, Florida; if the vehicle does not possess the State inspection certificate, as required by Section 30-119 [now 30-390] of the Code of Miami-Dade County, Florida; and it is unlawful to operate this vehicle on any street in the County, if the vehicle is not licensed in accordance with State law; or if the operator is not wearing a safety helmet or shield as required by law."
