<catch_line>Sec. 2-56.28.11. Legislative findings and purpose</catch_line>
<text>
The Board of County Commissioners finds that it is in the best interests of the County to ensure that employees who have knowledge of unlawful activity, misfeasance or malfeasance by the County or independent contractors report such knowledge to the appropriate authorities for investigation and corrective action. In order to encourage employees to report such information without fear of reprisal, it shall be the policy of the County to prohibit adverse action against an employee for disclosing such information to an appropriate official or agency and to award such employees when the information they disclose leads to the County's recovery of public funds.
Recognizing that the State of Florida has adopted its own Whistle-blower's Act, Fla. Stat. Sections 112.3187, et. seq. (1993) and that the State Act provides for the adoption of local procedures for administrative enforcement, the Commission intends that this ordinance be interpreted consistently with the State Act, as it may from time to time be amended.
