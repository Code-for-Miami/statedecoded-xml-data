Title. This section shall be referred to as the Miami-Dade County Community Small Business Enterprise ("CSBE") Program.
</section>
<section prefix = "2">
Definitions. The following definitions shall apply in this section:
Advisory board means the Community Small Business Enterprise Board created for the purpose of reviewing program activities and results, and for making recommendations to the Department of Small Business Development (SBD) and the Board of County Commissioners (BCC) on matters pertaining to the program.
Aggregate Set-Aside means an aggregated value of small construction contracts, no one contract of which exceeds five million dollars, which are to be bid during a fixed period of time on a contract-by-contract basis with bidding therefor reserved solely among qualified CSBEs classified in the applicable Contracting Participation Level and SIC or NAICS Code for the contract.
Available or availability means to have, prior to bid submission, the ability to provide construction services under a prime contract that is being considered for a set-aside or under a first or second, third, or fourth tier subcontract on a contract being considered for a first or lower tier subcontractor goal by having:
<section prefix = "1">
Reasonably estimated, uncommitted capacity and expertise;
</section>
<section prefix = "2">
All licenses, permits, registrations and certifications;
</section>
<section prefix = "3">
The ability to obtain bonding that is reasonably required to perform the contract or subcontract consistent with normal industry practice; and
</section>
<section prefix = "4">
The ability to otherwise meet bid specifications.

Bid means a quotation, proposal, letter of interest or offer by any bidder in response to any kind of invitation, request or public announcement to submit such quotation, proposal, letters of interest or offer to perform the contract.
Bid preference means an amount deducted (for evaluation purposes only) from the total bid price in order to calculate the bid price to be used to evaluate the bid on a competitively bid prime county construction contract, which is not set-aside for bidding solely by CSBEs.
Bidder means any person, partnership, corporation or other business entity that submits a bid.
Bonding assistance may include providing assistance in preparing and completing bond packages as well as providing ending to be used for bonding purposes.
Business day means a regular week day (Monday through Friday) normally starting at 8:00 a.m. and finishing at 5:00 p.m., excluding Saturdays and Sundays and excluding all legal holidays recognized by the Federal, State or Miami-Dade County governments.
Calendar day means a twenty-four (24) hour period covering all days of the week (Monday through Sunday including all holidays), starting at 12:00 a.m. and finishing at 11:59 p.m.
Commercially useful function means contractual responsibility for the execution of a distinct element of the work of a contract by a business enterprise and the carrying out of the contractual responsibilities by actually performing, managing, and supervising the work involved. Acting as a broker is not considered a commercially useful function. The determination of whether an activity is a commercially useful function shall include:
<section prefix = "1">
The evaluation of the amount of work subcontracted;
</section>
<section prefix = "2">
Normal industry practices;
</section>
<section prefix = "3">
The skills, qualifications, or expertise of the enterprise to perform the work;
</section>
<section prefix = "4">
Whether the business' own personnel perform, manage, and/or supervise the work involved; and
</section>
</section>
<section prefix = "5">
Other relevant factors.

Commitment letter means a letter signed by an officer or other authorized representative of a bidder or proposer for a County construction contract containing a second, third or fourth tier subcontractor goal which specifically commits the bidder or proposer to meet such subcontractor goal.
Community Small Business Enterprise (CSBE) means a construction related enterprise, including a design-build firm, and any firm providing trades and/or services for the completion of a construction project, as defined in Chapter 10 of the Code of Miami-Dade County, which has an actual place of business in Miami-Dade County and whose average annual gross revenues for the last three (3) years do not exceed: ten million dollars ($10,000,000.00) for SIC 15 - Building Construction, General Contractors and Operative Builders; six million dollars ($6,000,000.00) for SIC 16 - Heavy Construction, other than Building Construction; or five million dollars ($5,000,000.00) for SIC 17 - Specialty Trade Contractors. CSBEs shall be categorized by the type of construction they perform in accordance with the two-digit Standard Industrial Classification (SIC) code, or the six-digit North American Industry Classification System (NAICS), of the Census applicable to such type of construction. A CSBE will graduate out of the program upon notification by SBD that it has exceeded these size limits based on its three-year average annual gross revenues. A certified CSBE that graduates out of the program shall continue to submit financial information as to cumulative gross revenue and bonding capacity to SBD annually for 3 years thereafter in order to further the County's ability to assess the effectiveness of the program.
The County Mayor or designee shall be authorized to adjust the CSBE-size limits every five (5) years at his/her discretion based on the local Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers (CPI-U) calculated by the U.S. Department of Commerce or other appropriate tool of inflation measures as applied to Miami-Dade County for the preceding five (5) years. The first indexing adjustment shall occur for the 2013—2014 calendar year using the figures provided for the calendar year ended December 31, 2012, and every five (5) years thereafter. The County Mayor or designee shall advise the Board of any such adjustment.
CSBEs must be certified by SIC or NAICS code, and classified into one (1) of the three (3) contracting participation levels. The lack of bonding capacity shall not preclude an applicant from being certified as a CSBE. As part of the certification process, CSBEs must go through a prequalification process which will be used to determine which of the three (3) contracting participation levels the CSBE will be placed in based on the firm's three (3) year average gross revenues. The contracting participation levels are as follows:
<section prefix = "1">
Level I—Three-year average gross revenues of $0.00—$2,000,000.00;
</section>
<section prefix = "2">
Level II—Three-year average gross revenues above $2,000,000.00 but not exceeding $5,000,000.00; or
</section>
<section prefix = "3">
Level III—Three-year average gross revenues above $5,000,000.00 but not exceeding $10,000,000.00.

A firm's eligibility to participate in the CSBE program and the contracting participation level at which it will participate shall be determined based on the three-year average gross revenues of the applicant firm in combination with that of all of the firm's affiliates as provided in Appendix A [which can be found in the County Clerk's office attached to Ordinance Number 97-52]. No firm shall be certified as a CSBE where the individual net worth of any of its owners is more than one million five hundred thousand dollars ($1,500,000.00). Representations as to gross revenues and net worth of owners shall be subject to audit.
Notwithstanding any other provision of this Section 10-33.02, Level II and Level III CSBEs certified in SIC Code 17 - Specialty Trade Contractors, may bid on a specialty trade contract set aside for CSBEs whose estimated cost is above $50,000 and may participate in any specialty trade portion of the work of a contract subject to a CSBE subcontractor goal where the cost of the specialty trade portion of the contract work is above $50,000.
Construction means the building, renovating, retrofitting, rehabing, restoration, painting, altering or repairing of a public improvement.
Construction Manager-at-Risk ("CM-at-Risk") replaces the general contractor and works for a fee with the County and the Architect through the design phase to contain the budget and schedule. The CM-at-Risk may provide a guaranteed maximum price ("GMP"), and bids the work out to local trade contractors. The CM-at-Risk mobilizes to the site and manages the trade contractors for quality and schedule.
Construction Services means construction, maintenance, painting, alteration, installation, or repair of a public improvement or any performance of work offered for public consumption that does not consist primarily of goods.
Contract means an agreement proposed by the County or Public Health Trust staff, or approved by the County Commission or Public Health Trust for construction.
Contracting participation level refers to the level in which a CSBE firm is classified based on the average gross revenues of the firm over a three-year period. In addition, construction contracts of ten million dollars ($10,000,000.00) or less (which may be reserved for limited competition amongst CSBEs) will be classified into one (1) of the three (3) contracting participation levels based on estimated project cost. The three (3) contracting participation levels are:
<section prefix = "1">
Level I—Three-year average gross revenues of $0—$2,000,000.00
</section>
<section prefix = "2">
Level II—Three-year average gross revenues above $2,000,000.00 but not exceeding $5,000,000.00
</section>
<section prefix = "3">
Level III—Three-year average gross revenues above $5,000,000.00 but not exceeding $10,000,000.00

Notwithstanding any other provision of this Section 10-33.02, Level II and Level III CSBEs certified in SIC Code 17 - Specialty Trade Contractors, may bid on a specialty trade contract set aside for CSBEs whose estimated cost is above $50,000 and may participate in any specialty trade portion of the work of a contract subject to a CSBE subcontractor goal where the cost of the specialty trade portion of the contract work is above $50,000.
Prime contracts with estimated project construction cost in excess of ten million dollars ($10,000,000.00) shall be "open market" contracts which all firms can bid on.
CSBEs prequalified in one (1) contracting participation level may not bid on a set-aside contract whose estimated cost falls within a lower contracting participation level (e.g., a CSBE classified in Level III may not bid on set-aside contracts whose estimated cost falls within Level II or I). CSBEs can bid on set-aside contracts whose estimated cost exceeds the limits of the contracting participation level in which they are classified (e.g., a Level I CSBE can bid on set-aside contracts whose estimated cost falls within Level II or III).
CSBE objective means the objective of assuring that not less than ten (10) percent of the County's total annual expenditures for construction are expended with CSBEs. The foregoing CSBE objective may be increased by subsequent resolution of the Board of County Commissioners, adopted after recommendation for an increase by the Advisory Board. Forty (40) percent of the foregoing objective may be accomplished through set-aside of smaller prime contracts and use of subcontractor goals on larger prime contracts falling within Standard Industrial Classification (SIC) code 15; forty (40) percent of the foregoing objective may be accomplished through set-aside of smaller prime contracts and use of subcontractor goals on larger prime contracts falling within SIC 16; and twenty (20) percent of the foregoing objective may be accomplished in prime contracts falling within SIC 17. The percentage of the overall CSBE objective allocated to each SIC category may be adjusted by resolution of the Board of County Commissioners in direct correlation to CSBE availability.
Draw means a request for payment submitted by the prime contractor to the County or County's designee. A scheduled draw occurs, according to the contract's payment schedule, when the prime contractor is allowed to submit its request for payment. The date(s) of a scheduled draw may be stated with specificity in the contract in the form of a payment schedule or may be stated as a reoccurring event taking place, for example, on the 30th of each month.
Graduation means the CSBE has exceeded the specific size limits stated for the program, based on the firm's three-year average annual gross revenues, and will no longer be eligible for participation in the program.
Guaranteed maximum price ("GMP") is the cost of the project that the CM-at-Risk guaranteed will not be exceeded.
Joint venture means an association of two (2) or more CSBEs. Joint ventures shall be subject to the size limitations set forth in this section; such size limitations include affiliates as set forth in Appendix A [which can be found in the County Clerk's office attached to Ordinance Number 97-52].
Management and Technical Assistance (MTA) means a program designed to provide direct and indirect assistance for small business enterprise development. Specific details of the program are shown in Attachment 3 [which can be found in the County Clerk's office attached to Ordinance Number 97-52].
Mentor-Protege Program is a program whose purpose is to build effective working relationships between leaders of mature established companies and emerging small business enterprises in order for the latter to benefit from the knowledge and experience of the established mentor firms. A copy of the Miami-Dade County Mentor-Protege Program is provided as Attachment 1 [which can be found in the County Clerk's office attached to Ordinance Number 97-52].
Miscellaneous Construction Contracts are open contracts designed to consolidate an indeterminate number of individual small construction, repair, installation, or alteration activities which may be needed over a fixed period of time, or open contracts that are work order based where no specific item quantities have been determined prior to bid (unit price contracts).
Prequalification is defined as provided elsewhere in this ordinance.
Primary Trade Contractor means those contractors who directly contract with the CM-at-Risk. This definition only applies to contracts for a construction manager-at-risk.
Program incentive is an incentive that a firm can choose to use in a bid or proposal based on the firm's participation in certain programs. The incentive consists of either a bid preference or selection factor that will be used in evaluating the firm's bid on a specific project. The program incentives available are as follows:
<section prefix = "1">
For participation in the Mentor-Protege' Program—Two (2) percent of bid price or up to ten (10) percent of the total evaluation points;
</section>
<section prefix = "2">
For participation in the Worker Training Program—Two (2) percent of the bid price or up to ten (10) percent of the total evaluation points.

Qualifier means the individual who has qualified a contractor for its current, valid certificate of competency or eligibility as required by Subsection (a) of Section 10-3 of this Code.
Review Committee or RC means the committee established by the County Mayor or designee to review proposed projects for the application of contract measures where SBD and contracting department have not established consensus.
SBD means the Miami-Dade County Department of Small Business Development, or successor agency.
Selection factor means a percentage of total evaluation points added to the points scored by a proposer responding to an RFP or RFQ for a prime County construction contract which is not set-aside for competition solely amongst CSBEs.
Set-aside means reservation for competition solely among CSBEs of a given prime County contract whose estimated cost is ten million dollars ($10,000,000.00) or less.
SIC (Standard Industrial Classification) or the equivalent North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is a code that was developed by the Federal Office of Management and Budget for use in the classification of establishments by type of activity in which they are engaged.
Subcontractor goal means a proportion of a prime contract value stated as a percentage to be subcontracted to CSBEs to perform a commercially useful function. A first tier subcontract goal may be imposed where there is CSBE availability at such tier level. A second, third and fourth tier subcontract goal may be imposed on those contracts whose estimated cost exceeds twenty-five million dollars ($25,000,000.00) where there is CSBE availability at such lower tier levels.
Trade set-aside means that an entire specialty trade component(s) of a County miscellaneous construction contract is reserved for first tier subcontracting amongst certified CSBEs (for example, the entire plumbing or roofing or electrical component of a specific contract is reserved for limited competition amongst certified CSBEs). All such subcontracts shall be in writing and shall be executed by the prime contractor and the first tier CSBE subcontractor.
Worker Training Program is a qualified training program or technical school or other such construction industry related training program, as approved by the advisory board.

Miami-Dade County Community Small Business Enterprise (CSBE) Program. The prompt payment provisions of this section shall take precedence over Section 2-8.1.4 of the Code ("Sherman S. Winn Prompt Payment Ordinance"), as to the contracts specified below:
<section prefix = "1">
Prompt payment.
<section prefix = "a">
The County Mayor or designee and the President of the Public Health Trust shall establish administrative procedures requiring that billings from contractors under prime construction contracts with Miami-Dade County or the Public Health Trust that are a CSBE contract set-aside or which contain a trade set-aside or subcontractor goal, shall be promptly reviewed and payment made to the prime contractor by the County or Trust on those amounts not in dispute within fourteen (14) calendar days of receipt of such billing by the County or the Trust.
The County and Trust shall notify the prime contractor, and the Department of Small Business Development (SBD), in writing, of those billings submitted by the prime which are in dispute, and the reasons why they are in dispute, within fourteen (14) calendar days of receipt of such billing by the County or Trust. This provision is applicable regardless of whether the disputed billing pertains to the work performed and/or billing of CSBE subcontractors. Reference is hereby made to Section 2-8.1.4(6) of the Code, which sets forth the procedures for improper invoices and resolution of disputes.
</section>
<section prefix = "b">
A prime contractor shall include in its billing to the County or Trust copies of those billings from CSBE subcontractors utilized to meet the subcontractor goal applicable to the contract which the contractor approves and whose cost is included in the payment requested from the County or Trust. A prime contract which contains a second, third or fourth tier subcontractor goal shall require all subcontractors in direct privity with a second or lower tier CSBE subcontractor, and all successive subcontractors on up to and including the first tier subcontractor level, to include portions of any lower tier CSBE subcontractor's billings which are approved by such subcontractors and are included in any payment amount they request.
Undisputed portions of billings from CSBEs that are submitted to the prime at least five (5) days or more before the date of the prime's next scheduled draw, must be submitted by the prime to the County in the prime's next scheduled draw, according to the contract's payment schedule. For example: if the County's billing cycle on the specific contract allows the prime to submit its draw on the 30th of each month, a CSBE that submits its billing to the prime on or before the 25th of the month shall have its billing included in the prime's next scheduled draw submitted to the County on the 30th.
Undisputed portions of billings from CSBEs that are submitted to the prime less than five (5) days before the prime's next scheduled draw, may be submitted in the next draw; however, said billings shall be submitted no later than in the prime's next subsequent scheduled draw. For example, if the County's billing cycle on the specific contract allows the prime to submit its draw on the 30th of each month, a CSBE that submits its billing to the prime after the 25th of the month but before the 30th of the month shall, at the latest, have its billing included in the prime's subsequent scheduled draw submitted to the County on the 30th of the following month.
Failure by the prime to include the CSBE's billing(s) in its next scheduled draw or subsequent scheduled draw to the County as outlined above, and absent notification of disputes, as set forth in subsection (3)(A)(1) herein, shall result in the prime making full payment directly to the CSBE for the full amount of the submitted billing(s). Full payment to the CSBE subcontractor for the particular billing(s) shall be made within the same number of days that the County has mandated as the billing cycle for said contract in operation, or within forty (40) calendar days of submittal of such billing(s) by the CSBE to the prime, whichever is less, regardless of whether the prime has received its payment from the County.
</section>
<section prefix = "c">
If for any reason, the prime contractor chooses not to submit any billings to the County on its next or subsequent scheduled draw, the prime contractor shall make full payment to the CSBE subcontractor(s) for billings submitted by the CSBE subcontractor(s) in accordance with the subsection above. Full payment to the CSBE subcontractor(s) for the particular billing(s) shall be made by the prime contractor within the same number of days that the County has mandated as the billing cycle for said contract in operation, or within forty (40) calendar days of submittal of such billing(s) by the CSBE subcontractor(s) to the prime contractor, whichever is less, regardless of whether the prime has received its payment from the County.
</section>
<section prefix = "d">
Prime construction contracts to which a CSBE trade set-aside or subcontractor goal has been applied shall require that billings from CSBEs at whatever subcontractor tier level for which the contract measure has been applied, shall be promptly reviewed and payment made to such CSBEs on those amounts not in dispute within two (2) business days of receipt of payment therefor. The foregoing obligation to promptly review and pay CSBE billings shall apply to prime contractors and subcontractors who are in direct privity with the CSBE and to each successive subcontractor on up the line to the level of prime contractor. The two (2) day payment provision shall equally apply to retainage payments received by prime contractors from the County, and subsequently passed on to subcontractors.

The prime contractor agrees to the contract requirements of Miami-Dade County, Florida Code, Section 10-35, Release of Claim by Subcontractors Required. The requirements found in Section 10-35 are hereby fully incorporated into this CSBE Prompt Payment Subsection and non-compliance, by failing to pay subcontractors and failing to provide the requisite subcontractor affidavit and/or consent of surety to requisition payment, shall be enforceable through this Subsection.
</section>
<section prefix = "f">
The prime contractor on a prime construction contract to which a CSBE trade set-aside or a first tier subcontractor goal has been applied shall inform the Department of Small Business Development, the Contracting Officer, and the first tier CSBE subcontractor, in writing, of those amounts billed by the CSBE which are in dispute, and the specific reasons why they are in dispute, within five (5) calendar days of submittal of such billing by the first tier CSBE subcontractor to the prime contractor. Prime contracts to which a second or lower tier subcontractor goal has been applied shall provide that subcontractors in direct privity with any CSBE utilized to meet such lower tier subcontractor goal, shall inform the affected CSBE in writing, with copies to the prime contractor and the Department of Small Business Development, of those amounts of such CSBE's billings that are disputed and the specific reasons therefor within five (5) calendar days of submittal of such billing from the CSBE.
Failure of the prime contractor to comply with the applicable requirements of this Subsection shall result in the prime contractor's forfeiture of the right to use the dispute as justification for not paying the first tier CSBE subcontractor and payment shall be forthcoming from the prime contractor. Prime contracts to which a second or lower tier subcontractor goal has been applied shall provide that a subcontractor in direct privity with a CSBE utilized to meet such goal who fails to comply with the applicable provisions of this Subsection shall result in such subcontractor's forfeiture of the right to use the dispute as justification for not paying the CSBE subcontractor and payment shall be forthcoming from such subcontractor.

The County Mayor or designee and the President of the Public Health Trust shall establish administrative procedures requiring that billings from contractors under prime construction contracts with Miami-Dade County or the Public Health Trust that are a CSBE contract set-aside or which contain a trade set-aside or subcontractor goal, shall be promptly reviewed and payment made to the prime contractor by the County or Trust on those amounts not in dispute within fourteen (14) calendar days of receipt of such billing by the County or the Trust.
The County and Trust shall notify the prime contractor, and the Department of Small Business Development (SBD), in writing, of those billings submitted by the prime which are in dispute, and the reasons why they are in dispute, within fourteen (14) calendar days of receipt of such billing by the County or Trust. This provision is applicable regardless of whether the disputed billing pertains to the work performed and/or billing of CSBE subcontractors. Reference is hereby made to Section 2-8.1.4(6) of the Code, which sets forth the procedures for improper invoices and resolution of disputes.

A prime contractor shall include in its billing to the County or Trust copies of those billings from CSBE subcontractors utilized to meet the subcontractor goal applicable to the contract which the contractor approves and whose cost is included in the payment requested from the County or Trust. A prime contract which contains a second, third or fourth tier subcontractor goal shall require all subcontractors in direct privity with a second or lower tier CSBE subcontractor, and all successive subcontractors on up to and including the first tier subcontractor level, to include portions of any lower tier CSBE subcontractor's billings which are approved by such subcontractors and are included in any payment amount they request.
Undisputed portions of billings from CSBEs that are submitted to the prime at least five (5) days or more before the date of the prime's next scheduled draw, must be submitted by the prime to the County in the prime's next scheduled draw, according to the contract's payment schedule. For example: if the County's billing cycle on the specific contract allows the prime to submit its draw on the 30th of each month, a CSBE that submits its billing to the prime on or before the 25th of the month shall have its billing included in the prime's next scheduled draw submitted to the County on the 30th.
Undisputed portions of billings from CSBEs that are submitted to the prime less than five (5) days before the prime's next scheduled draw, may be submitted in the next draw; however, said billings shall be submitted no later than in the prime's next subsequent scheduled draw. For example, if the County's billing cycle on the specific contract allows the prime to submit its draw on the 30th of each month, a CSBE that submits its billing to the prime after the 25th of the month but before the 30th of the month shall, at the latest, have its billing included in the prime's subsequent scheduled draw submitted to the County on the 30th of the following month.
Failure by the prime to include the CSBE's billing(s) in its next scheduled draw or subsequent scheduled draw to the County as outlined above, and absent notification of disputes, as set forth in subsection (3)(A)(1) herein, shall result in the prime making full payment directly to the CSBE for the full amount of the submitted billing(s). Full payment to the CSBE subcontractor for the particular billing(s) shall be made within the same number of days that the County has mandated as the billing cycle for said contract in operation, or within forty (40) calendar days of submittal of such billing(s) by the CSBE to the prime, whichever is less, regardless of whether the prime has received its payment from the County.

Before any prime contractor can receive any draw, except the first draw, for moneys due it as a result of a percentage of the work completed, it must pay all first-tier subcontractors and all direct suppliers of the prime contractor who have performed any work or supplied any materials directly to the prime contractor for the project as of that date their proportionate share of all previous draws and must provide the County's Project Manager with duly executed affidavits (subcontractor's statement of satisfaction) or releases of claim from all first-tier subcontractors and direct suppliers to the prime contractor who have performed any work or supplied any materials for the project as of that date, stating that said subcontractors and suppliers have been paid their proportionate share of all previous draws. In the event such affidavits cannot be furnished, the contractor may submit an executed consent of surety to requisition payment, identifying the subcontractors and suppliers, and the amounts for which the statement of satisfaction cannot be furnished. The contractor's failure to provide a consent of surety to requisition payment will result in the amount in dispute being withheld until (1) the statement of satisfaction is furnished, or (2) consent of surety to requisition payment is furnished.

Debarment:
<section prefix = "1">
The Debarment Committee may, in the public interest, debar a contractor for any of the causes listed in this ordinance, using the procedures outlined below. The existence of a cause for debarment, however, does not necessarily require that the contractor be debarred; the seriousness of the contractor's acts or omissions and any mitigating factors should be considered in making any debarment decision.
</section>
<section prefix = "2">
Debarment constitutes debarment of all officers, principals, directors, shareholders owning or controlling ten (10) percent or more of the stock, partners, qualifiers, divisions or other organizational elements of the debarred contractor, unless the debarred decision is limited by its terms to specific divisions, organizational elements, or commodities. The Debarment Committee's decision includes any existing affiliates of the contractor, if they are (i) specifically named and (ii) given written notice of the proposed debarment and an opportunity to respond. Future affiliates of the contractor are subject to the pre-existing Debarment Committee's decision.

The committee may debar a contractor, based upon a preponderance of the evidence, for:
<section prefix = "i">
Violation of the terms of a County contract or subcontract, or a contract or subcontract funded in whole or in part by County funds, such as willful failure to perform in accordance with the terms of one (1) or more contracts; or the failure to perform, or unsatisfactory performance of one (1) or more contracts.

<section prefix = "i">
Debarment procedures:
<section prefix = "1">
Investigation and referral. Departments shall promptly investigate and prepare written reports concerning a proposed debarment, and prepare written requests to DBD for the debarment of contractors the department believes is subject to any of the causes listed above. The County Manager (or his or her designee), and the Office of the Inspector General, may investigate, prepare written reports on, and prepare written requests for, debarment of contractors or subcontractors.
</section>
<section prefix = "2">
Upon receipt of a request for debarment, DBD shall create a Debarment Committee, from the Standing Pool of Committee members appointed by the County Manager, none of whose members shall include a representative from the department making the debarment request. DBD shall act as staff to the Debarment Committee. The department requesting debarment shall present evidence and argument to the Debarment Committee. In the event that the requesting department requests the assistance of the County Attorney's Office, the County Attorney's Office shall provide as counsel to the requesting department a representative of the office independent from any designated to advise the Debarment Committee in the proceedings.
</section>
<section prefix = "3">
Notice of proposal to debar. DBD, on behalf of the Debarment Committee, shall issue a notice of proposed debarment advising the contractor and any specifically named affiliates, by certified mail, return receipt requested, or personal service, that:
<section prefix = "i">
Debarment is being considered;
</section>
</section>
</section>
<section prefix = "ii">
Of the reasons and causes for the proposed debarment in terms sufficient to put the contractor on notice of the conduct or transaction(s) upon which it is based;
</section>
<section prefix = "iii">
That a hearing shall be conducted before the Debarment Committee on a date and time not less than twenty (20) days after service of the notice. The notice shall also advise the contractor that it may be represented by an attorney, may present documentary evidence and verbal testimony, and may cross-examine evidence and testimony presented against it.
</section>
<section prefix = "iv">
The notice shall also describe the effect of the issuance of the notice of proposed debarment, and of the potential effect of an actual debarment.
</section>
</section>
<section prefix = "4">
No later than seven (7) calendar days prior to the scheduled hearing date, the contractor must furnish DBD a list of the defenses, and the documents and records supporting those defenses, the contractor intends to present at the hearing. If the contractor fails to submit the list of defenses, in writing, and the documents and records supporting those defenses, at least seven (7) calendar days prior to the hearing, or fails to seek an extension of time, in writing, at least seven (7) calendar days prior to the hearing, within which to do so, the contractor shall have waived the opportunity to be heard at the hearing. Failure to request an extension at least seven (7) calendar days prior to the hearing shall constitute an absolute waiver to present defenses and to be heard before the Debarment Committee. The Debarment Committee Chair (or the Director of DBD, or his or her designee) has the right to grant or deny an extension of time so long as the request for an extension of time is made at least seven (7) calendar days prior to the hearing, and [[his or her decision may only be reviewed upon an abuse of discretion standard.
</section>
<section prefix = "5">
Discovery. The process of discovery, including the subpoenaing of witnesses, the taking of depositions, the submission of interrogatories, and requests for documents, is not permitted under this ordinance. However, any party may make a public records request under Chapter 119 of the Florida Statutes.
</section>
<section prefix = "6">
Hearsay evidence shall be admissible at the hearing but shall not form the sole basis for initiating a debarment procedure nor the sole basis of any determination of debarment. The hearing shall be transcribed, taped or otherwise recorded by use of a court reporter, at the election of the committee and at the expense of the county. Copies of the hearing tape or transcript shall be furnished at the expense and request of the requesting party.
</section>
<section prefix = "7">
Debarment Committee's decision. In actions based upon a conviction or judgment, or in which there is no genuine dispute over material facts, the Debarment Committee shall make a decision on the basis of all the undisputed, material information in the administrative record, including any undisputed, material submissions made by the contractor. Where actions are based on disputed evidence, the Debarment Committee shall decide what weight to attach to evidence of record, judge the credibility of witnesses, and base its decision on the preponderance of the evidence standard. In the event that the contractor fails to appear at the debarment hearing or to present competent proof under affirmation or oath through persons with direct knowledge of the contractor's performance, the contractor shall be presumed to be not responsible and subject to debarment. The Debarment Committee's decision shall be based on a majority of the members of the Committee. The Debarment Committee shall be the sole trier of fact. The committee's decision shall be made within twenty (20) working days after conclusion of the hearing, unless the Debarment Committee extends this period for good cause.
</section>
<section prefix = "8">
The committee's decision shall be in writing and shall include the committee's factual findings, the principal causes of debarment as enumerated in this Ordinance, identification of the contractor and all affiliates affected by the decision, and the specific term, including duration, of the debarment imposed.

If the County Manager does not override the Debarment Committee's decision within twenty (20) working days of the date of the Debarment Committee's written decision, and does not sign the notice to the contractor as stated in Section (i)(9) above, the Debarment Committee's decision is final, and becomes effective on the twenty-first (21st) working day after the date of the Debarment Committee's written decision.
